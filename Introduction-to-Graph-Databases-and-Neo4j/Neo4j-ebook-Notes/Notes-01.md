####Chapter 1 : Graphs & Graph Theory
---------------------------------

Requirements : Neo4j Community Edition, Java7 or above

######Graphs :

* Invented by Leonhard Euler, while he was trying to solve the '7 bridges of Konigsberg' problem. (Pathfinding Operation)

* A graph is a mathematical representation of two or more entities, connected by a relationship.



######Components of a Graph :

* Nodes - a.k.a Vertices; representing objects/entities.

* Links - a.k.a Relationships or edges; connection between Nodes.
[Number of edges connected to a Node - Degree of that Node]



######Graph Theory :

* The study of Graph Models & Algorithms. Eg: Social Networks, Biological Studies, Computer Science - Graph Computing Engines, Coding - If a change is made to one 'object' in the code, how much of would it affect(dependency analysis algorithms), Flow/Routing Problems, Google's Page Rank Algorithm.
