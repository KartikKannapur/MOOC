####Chapter 4 : Modelling Data for Neo4j
------------------------------------------


######Data Constructs 

* The underlying data structure/data model of Neo4j - 'Property Graph', is flexible enough to support a myraid of real world datasets.

* Nodes : Entities

* Relationships : Connection between Nodes in a Graph. Join, unlike in RDBMS, are no longer a query-time operation. They are traversals through the graph(from node-to-node). Relationships always have a 'start node' & a 'end node' and a direction between the nodes. They can be self-referencing, but never dangling.

* Properties : Both Nodes & Relationships can have properties, in the form of name:value pairs.

* Lables : Creation of sub-graphs. Labels can be used for indexing, graph sharding etc.



######Graph Modelling

* Index Lookups are similar to searching for a key-value pair.
