####Chapter 2 : Graph Databases
-------------------------------

A comparision between traditional databases & modern-day graph databases, such as Neo4j.

######Background :

* Database - Organized collection of data.

* Databases can be broadly classified into 3 types - Navigational Databases, Relational Databases, NoSQL Databases.

* Navigational Databases - Networks or hierarchies as the basic structure of data. | Both these database systems were built based on the premise that elements in the data, would be linked by pointers (pointing from one element to another - Linked Lists of Data) | Navigational Databases eventually led the way to RDBMS.

* Relational Database Management Systems(RDBMS) - Essentially Set Operations | Birth of the Structured Query Language(SQL) | Normalization- Minimize database redundancy & Save space. -> This process involves splitting recurring data into different tables & then performing a 'join' to aggregate the data. | Although the RDBMS had/has several advantages, it also has many disadvantages(leading to a Graph Database System) - 1) As the data grows, query time increases ; 2) As the relationship between data in the various tables increases, it becomes increasingly hard to write complex join operations ; 3)RDBMS Systems impose a rigid schema(less dynamic/ on-the-go).

* NoSQL Databases - Task Oriented Databases -> 1) Key-Value stores 2) Document Stores 3) Column-Famiy Stores 4) Graph Databases
