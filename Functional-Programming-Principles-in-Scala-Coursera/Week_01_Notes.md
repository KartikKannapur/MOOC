## Week 1 - Functional Programming in Scala

##### Introduction:

* Functional programming promotes code that is safe, concise & elegant.

* Scala is a language that fuses functional & object-oriented programming in a practical package + Interoperation with Java and its tools + Runs on the standard Java Platform.

* Programming in Scala - Paradigm Shift

* Difference between val & var keywords in Scala: 

> val num_a: Int = 5 (Makes the variables num_a immutable i.e cannot be changed; helpful for defining constants)

>var num_a: Int = 5 (Makes the variable mutable)

* Scala stands for scalable language. It was termed so, because it was designed to scale/grow with the demand of its users.

* Functional Programming is a whole new paradigm in itself. A paradigm describes distinct concepts or thought patterns. | The major programming paradigms are - Imperative Programming, Functional Programming, Object-Oriented Programming & Logic Programming.

* "If we want to implement high-level concepts and their mathematical theories, then we must get rid of mutation."

* Functional Programming - Programming without mutable varibles, assignments, loops and other imperative control structures. | Keeping the main focus on functions. | 'Functions' in a Functional Programming Langauge are First-Class citizens - meaning they can be defined anywhere, they can be passed as parameters.

* Examples of FP Languages - Haskell, Lisp, Scheme, Clojure, Ocaml, Scala, Erlang

* FP has become increasingly popular - Better Modularity | Exploiting parallelism for multicore and cloud computing.

##### Talk: Martin Odersky, "Working Hard to Keep It Simple" - OSCON Java 2011

* Concurrency & Parallelism - Concurrent : Manage concurrent execution threads explicitly (Inherently concurrent application. Eg: Real-time Applications) | Parallel : Execute programs faster on parallel hardware(But these programs could run sequentially).

* Parallelism - Collections | Concurrency - Akka

##### Getting Started with Scala


* REPL - Read - Evaluate - Print - Loop

* Starting the REPL
> scala

* Getting Help with Scala ':help'

* def func_name(x: return_type_of_x, y: return_type_of_y): return_type_of_function = ...

Int, Double, Boolean

* Substitution Model - Evaluate & Reduce an expression to a value

* Semi-colon inference in Scala - ';' - Infers that the end of a line would contain a semi-colon.
