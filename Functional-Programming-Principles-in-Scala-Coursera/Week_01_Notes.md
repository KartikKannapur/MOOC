## Week 1 - Functional Programming in Scala
--------------------------------------------

##### Introduction:

* Functional programming promotes code that is safe, concise & elegant.

* Scala is a language that fuses functional & object-oriented programming in a practical package + Interoperation with Java and its tools + Runs on the standard Java Platform.

* Programming in Scala - Paradigm Shift

* Difference between val & var keywords in Scala: 

val num_a: Int = 5 (Makes the variables num_a immutable i.e cannot be changed; helpful for defining constants)

var num_a: Int = 5 (Makes the variable mutable)

* Scala stands for scalable language. It was termed so, because it was designed to scale/grow with the demand of its users.
