* R as a Programming Language

* R is a dialect of the 'S Language'.

* Local files & modules are saved in the working directory.

* R == Free Software

Freedom's of Free Software : Use the program as you like | Modify the program to suit your needs | Re-distribute copies of the program | Improve the program and share the improvements with the community.

* Objects used in R are stored in the physical memeory of the machine. In case the size of the object is too large, it may exceed the physical memory & throw an error.

* CRAN - Comprehensive R Archive Network

* 4000+ R Packages/Libraries on CRAN

* At the R Prompt we type expressions.

* Everything in R is an object.

* Atomic Data Types in R - char, int, complex numbers, logical/boolean.

* Infinity in R is represented by Inf (-Inf exists as well)

* Lists - Contain elements of different classes.

* Factors - Used to represent categorical data i.e things which can be seperated via a Label. 

* NA & NaN values in R : To Check - is.na(), is.nan() - missing value

* Data Frame - Tabular data - Special type of list, where every column has the same length (need not be the same class/type)

* Matrices have to store the same type() or class() of element in the entire matrix. Data Frames do not have this constraint.

* R objects can also have names.
