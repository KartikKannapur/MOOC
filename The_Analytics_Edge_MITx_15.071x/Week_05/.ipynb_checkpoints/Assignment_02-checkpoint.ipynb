We compared the response of nonresponding patients who continued the same treatment with that of patients who switched to a well-tolerated non-cross-resistant regimen. METHODS: Previously untreated breast cancer patients received two 3-week cycles of docetaxel at 75 mg/m(2), doxorubicin at 50 mg/m(2), and cyclophosphamide at 500 mg/m(2) per day (TAC). Patients whose tumors did not decrease in size by at least 50% were randomly assigned to four additional cycles of TAC or to four cycles of vinorelbine at 25 mg/m(2) and capecitabine at 2000 mg/m(2) (NX). The outcome was sonographic response, defined as a reduction in the product of the two largest perpendicular diameters by at least 50%. A difference of 10% or less in the sonographic response qualified as noninferiority of the NX treatment. Pathological complete response was defined as no invasive or in situ residual tumor masses in the breast and lymph nodes. Toxic effects were assessed. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: Of 2090 patients enrolled in the GeparTrio study, 622 (29.8%) who did not respond to two initial cycles of TAC were randomly assigned to an additional four cycles of TAC (n = 321) or to four cycles of NX (n = 301). Sonographic response rate was 50.5% for the TAC arm and 51.2% for the NX arm. The difference of 0.7% (95% confidence interval = -7.1% to 8.5%) demonstrated noninferiority of NX (P = .008). Similar numbers of patients in both arms received breast-conserving surgery (184 [57.3%] in the TAC arm vs 180 [59.8%] in the NX arm) and had a pathological complete response (5.3% vs 6.0%). Fewer patients in the NX arm than in the TAC arm had hematologic toxic effects, mucositis, infections, and nail changes, but more had hand-foot syndrome and sensory neuropathy. CONCLUSION: Pathological complete responses to both regimens were marginal. Among patients who did not respond to the initial neoadjuvant TAC treatment, similar efficacy but better tolerability was observed by switching to NX than continuing with TAC.</td><td>1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      </td></tr>\n",

The primary endpoint of study-5-year disease-free survival (DFS)-was assessed by Kaplan-Meier analysis. Secondary endpoints included overall survival and analysis of the prognostic and predictive value of clinical and molecular (hormone receptors by immunohistochemistry and HER2 by fluorescence in situ hybridization) markers. Associations and interactions were assessed with a multivariable Cox proportional hazards model for DFS for the following covariates: age, menopausal status, tumor size, lymph node status, type of chemotherapy, tumor size, positive lymph nodes, HER2 status, and hormone receptor status. All statistical tests were two-sided.RESULTS: Among the 1246 eligible patients, estimated rates of DFS at 5 years were 78.5% in the FEC-P arm and 72.1% in the FEC arm (difference = 6.4%, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.6% to 11.2%; P = .006). FEC-P treatment was associated with a 23% reduction in the risk of relapse compared with FEC treatment (146 relapses in the 614 patients in the FEC-P arm vs 193 relapses in the 632 patients in the FEC arm, hazard ratio [HR] = 0.77, 95% CI = 0.62 to 0.95; P = .022) and a 22% reduction in the risk of death (73 and 95 deaths, respectively, HR = 0.78, 95% CI = 0.57 to 1.06; P = .110). Among the 928 patients for whom tumor samples were centrally analyzed, type of chemotherapy (FEC vs FEC-P) (P = .017), number of involved axillary lymph nodes (P &lt; .001), tumor size (P = .020), hormone receptor status (P = .004), and HER2 status (P = .006) were all associated with DFS. We found no statistically significant interaction between HER2 status and paclitaxel treatment or between hormone receptor status and paclitaxel treatment.CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with operable breast cancer, FEC-P treatment statistically significantly reduced the risk of relapse compared with FEC as adjuvant therapy.</td><td>1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          </td></tr>\n",

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 260 women with measurable metastatic breast cancer fulfilling high-risk criteria, previously untreated with chemotherapy for their metastatic disease, were randomized to receive either mitoxantrone 12 mg/m(2) or the combination of fluorouracil 500 mg/m(2), epirubicin 50 mg/m(2) and cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m(2) (FEC) every 3 weeks. Treatment was continued until complete remission plus two cycles, or until disease progression. In the case of partial remission or stable disease, treatment was stopped after 12 cycles. Second-line treatment was vindesine, mitomycin and prednisolone. Gain from treatment was estimated using a modified Brunner's score composed of time to progression, patients' rating of the treatment benefit, alopecia, vomiting and performance status. RESULTS: After recruitment from 1992 to 1997 and observation from 1997 to 1999, the final evaluation showed that single-agent treatment with mitoxantrone does not differ significantly from combination treatment with FEC in terms of response, objective remission rate, remission duration, time to response, time to best response, time to progression or overall survival. There was, however, a significant difference in gain from treatment using a modified Brunner's score favoring the single-agent treatment arm. There was no evidence that any subgroup would fare better with combination treatment. CONCLUSIONS: No significant difference was detected between the treatment with mitoxantrone as a single agent and the combination of low-dose FEC in terms of response or survival; therefore, the imperative of the necessity of first-line combination chemotherapy for patients with high-risk metastatic breast cancer may be questioned. Since toxicity and quality of life score favored the single-agent mitoxantrone treatment arm, this treatment may be offered to patients preferring quality of life to a potential small prolongation of survival.</td><td>1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              </td></tr>\n",

Expression of Bcl-2 was determined using immunohistochemistry on paraffin-embedded sections in a series of 441 premenopausal, lymph node-negative breast cancers of patients randomised to receive perioperative chemotherapy (5-fluorouracil, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide) or no perioperative chemotherapy. Immunohistochemistry of Bcl-2 was evaluated by scoring both staining intensity (0-3) and number of positive cells (0-2). Using these scores tumours were grouped into categories 0-6. It was found that 9.2% of the tumours were completely negative (0), 17.2% weakly (1 + 2), 41.6% moderately (3 + 4) and 31.9% strongly positive (5 + 6) for Bcl-2. A positive correlation was found between high Bcl-2 expression and oestrogen (P &lt; 0.001) and progesterone receptor positivity (P &lt; 0.001) and low tumour grade (P &lt; 0.001), whereas high Bcl-2 expression was negatively correlated with p53 (P &lt; 0.001) and c-erb-B-2 positively (P &lt; 0.001), high Ki-67 index (P &lt; 0.001), mitotic index (P &lt; 0.001) and large tumour size (P = 0.006). Patients with tumours expressing high levels of Bcl-2 (overall score 3-6) had a significantly better disease-free (P = 0.004) and overall (P = 0.009) survival. However, in a multivariate model this association no longer remained significant. There was a trend for an effect of adjuvant chemotherapy on disease-free survival both for patients with Bcl-2-positive (HR-0.61, 95% CI 0.35-1.06, P = 0.07) and negative (HR = 0.55, 95% CI 0.27-1.12, P = 0.09) breast tumours at a median follow-up of 49 months. The level of Bcl-2 expression does not seem to predict response to perioperative chemotherapy in premenopausal, lymph node-negative breast cancer patients. High levels of Bcl-2 are preferentially expressed in well-differentiated tumours and are associated with favourable prognosis. However, Bcl-2 expression is not an independent prognostic factor in this patient series.</td><td>0                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   </td></tr>\n",

Both agents are highly active as monotherapy in a number of tumors, including metastatic breast cancer. Therefore, we performed a phase I dose-finding study to determine the maximum tolerated dose of this combination regimen in patients with advanced solid tumors. A total of 45 patients were enrolled and received cyclophosphamide followed by docetaxel, both administered as 1-hour intravenous infusions once every 3 weeks. The dose levels of cyclophosphamide/docetaxel were 600/60 mg/m2 (group 0), 600/75 mg/m2 (group I), 700/75 mg/m2 (group 2), 800/75 mg/m2 (group 3), 800/85 mg/m2 (group 4), 800/75 mg/m2 (group 5), and 800/85 mg/m2 (group 6). Patients with dose-limiting neutropenia in groups 5 and 6 received 300 micrograms of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) (filgrastim [Neupogen]) support on days 2 through 9 during subsequent cycles of chemotherapy. All patients received premedication with 8 mg of dexamethasone twice daily for 5 days, beginning 1 day prior to chemotherapy. The dose-limiting toxicity was neutropenia fever. The recommended dose for phase II studies of cyclophosphamide/docetaxel is 700/75 mg/m2 in previously treated patients and 800/75 mg/m2 in previously untreated patients. G-CSF support did not allow for further dose escalation. Preliminary results from this phase I trial indicate that the combination of docetaxel and cyclophosphamide produced an objective response rate of 69% in 32 patients with metastatic breast cancer (including 3 patients who achieved complete responses).</td><td>1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        </td></tr>\n",

Aromatase inhibitors (AIs) are increasingly used after initial tamoxifen in the adjuvant treatment of postmenopausal early breast cancer due to their mechanism of action: a potential benefit being a reduction of uterine abnormalities caused by tamoxifen.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sonographic uterine effects of the steroidal AI exemestane were studied in 219 women participating in the Intergroup Exemestane Study: a large trial in postmenopausal women with estrogen receptor-positive (or unknown) early breast cancer, disease free after 2-3 years of tamoxifen, randomly assigned to continue tamoxifen or switch to exemestane to complete 5 years adjuvant treatment. The primary end point was the proportion of patients with abnormal (&gt; or =5 mm) endometrial thickness (ET) on transvaginal ultrasound 24 months after randomisation.RESULTS: The analysis included 183 patients. Two years after randomisation, the proportion of patients with abnormal ET was significantly lower in the exemestane compared with tamoxifen arm (36% versus 62%, respectively; P = 0.004). This difference emerged within 6 months of switching treatment (43.5% versus 65.2%, respectively; P = 0.01) and disappeared within 12 months of treatment completion (30.8% versus 34.7%, respectively; P = 0.67).CONCLUSION: Switching from tamoxifen to exemestane significantly reverses endometrial thickening associated with continued tamoxifen.</td><td>0                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        </td></tr>\n",

However, whether the same benefits apply also in postmenopausal women treated with adjuvant tamoxifen for similar high-risk cancer is unclear. In a randomised trial among postmenopausal women who had undergone mastectomy, we compared adjuvant tamoxifen alone with tamoxifen plus postoperative radiotherapy. METHODS: Between 1982 and 1990, postmenopausal women with high-risk breast cancer (stage II or III) were randomly assigned adjuvant tamoxifen (30 mg daily for 1 year) alone (689) or with postoperative radiotherapy to the chest wall and regional lymph nodes (686). Median follow-up was 123 months. The endpoints were first site of recurrence (locoregional recurrence, distant metastases, or both), and disease-free and overall survival. FINDINGS: Locoregional recurrence occurred in 52 (8%) of the radiotherapy plus tamoxifen group and 242 (35%) of the tamoxifen only group (p&lt;0.001). In total there were 321 (47%) and 411 (60%) recurrences, respectively. Disease-free survival was 36% in the radiotherapy plus tamoxifen group and 24% in the tamoxifen alone group (p&lt;0.001). Overall survival was also higher in the radiotherapy group (385 vs 434 deaths; survival 45 vs 36% at 10 years, p=0.03). INTERPRETATION: Postoperative radiotherapy decreased the risk of locoregional recurrence and was associated with improved survival in high-risk postmenopausal breast-cancer patients after mastectomy and limited axillary dissection, with 1 year of adjuvant tamoxifen treatment. Improved survival in high-risk breast cancer can best be achieved by a strategy of both locoregional and systemic tumour control.</td><td>0                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              </td></tr>\n",

The primary study endpoint was the provider-assessed maximal grade of Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 3.0, radiation dermatitis. The secondary endpoints included provider-assessed Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Grade 3 or greater radiation dermatitis and adverse event monitoring. The patient-reported outcome measures included the Skindex-16, the Skin Toxicity Assessment Tool, a Symptom Experience Diary, and a quality-of-life self-assessment. An assessment was performed at baseline, weekly during radiotherapy, and for 2 weeks after radiotherapy.RESULTS: A total of 176 patients were enrolled between September 21, 2007, and December 7, 2007. The provider-assessed primary endpoint showed no difference in the mean maximum grade of radiation dermatitis by treatment arm (1.2 for MMF vs. 1.3 for placebo; p = .18). Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events toxicity was greater in the placebo group (p = .04), primarily from pruritus. For the patient-reported outcome measures, the maximum Skindex-16 score for the MMF group showed less itching (p = .008), less irritation (p = .01), less symptom persistence or recurrence (p = .02), and less annoyance with skin problems (p = .04). The group's maximal Skin Toxicity Assessment Tool score showed less burning sensation (p = .02) and less itching (p = .002).CONCLUSION: Patients receiving daily MMF during radiotherapy might experience reduced acute skin toxicity compared with patients receiving placebo.</td><td>0                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     </td></tr>\n",

A controlled trial of 128 patients showed that in a variety of recurrent cases the addition of warfarin to chemotherapy doubled the 2-year survival rate. The best results were obtained in postmenopausal patients with breast cancer. Warfarin depresses cellular immune responses which might militate against its use for cases undergoing \"curative\" surgery. Instead, induction of fibrinolysis by streptokinase or Brinase is suggested, because it increases the activity of the cellular immune mechanism. The results to date of an ongoing controlled randomized trial of streptokinase with surgery of tumors of the large bowel are presented, showing that the trends are in favor of streptokinase therapy; however, insufficient time has elapsed to make it, as yet, statistically significant. The action of streptokinase-induced plasmin and Brinase on lymphocytes is described.</td><td>0                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            </td></tr>\n",

We performed a randomised Phase II study to assess the safety and relative toxicity of AC (doxorubicin; cyclophosphamide) vs E(epirubicin)C given by conventional or accelerated schedules as neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy for early breast cancer. Furthermore, the relative toxicity of doxorubicin and epirubicin remains uncertain. Patients were randomised to one of four arms; four courses of standard 3 weekly cyclophosphamide 600 mg m(-2) in combination with doxorubicin 60 mg m(-2) (AC) vs epirubicin 90 mg m(-2) (EC) 3 weekly vs the same regimens administered every 2 weeks with pegfilgrastim (G-CSF). A total of 126 patients were treated, 42 with standard AC, 42 with accelerated AC, 19 with standard EC and 23 with accelerated EC. Significantly more grade 3/4 day one neutropenia was seen with standard (6/61, 10%) compared to accelerated (0/65,) regimens (P=0.01). A trend towards more neutropenic sepsis was seen in the combined standard and accelerated AC arms (12/84, 14%) compared to the combined EC arms (1/42, 2%), P=0.06. Falls in left ventricular ejection fraction were not increased with accelerated treatment. Accelerated AC and EC with pegfilgrastim are safe and feasible regimens in the treatment of early breast cancer with less neutropenia than conventional 3 weekly schedules.</td><td>1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              </td></tr>\n",

The survival for patients with advanced HCC is extremely poor. This is largely attributed to the lack of effective screening methods, advanced stage at presentation, limited utility of surgical intervention and ineffective medical therapy. Over the past 30 years, many conventional cytotoxic agents have been tested and have failed to confer a survival benefit. Recently, sorafenib, a multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitor, was approved by the US FDA as first-line therapy in HCC as the first agent demonstrating survival benefit in this disease. Although the survival benefit demonstrated by sorafenib is moderate, molecular targeted therapy has brought new hope in the management of HCC.</td><td>0                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       </td></tr>\n",

Tumour response to chemotherapy was evaluated based on histology from a surgical specimen collected upon completion of chemotherapy.RESULTS: Sixty women were enrolled into the study. Thirty-one received docetaxel followed by anthracyclines (Arm A) and 29 received drugs in the reverse order (Arm B). Most women (83%) had ductal carcinoma and 10 women (17%) had lobular or lobular/ductal carcinoma. All but one tumour were downstaged during therapy. Overall, there was no significant difference in response between the two drug regimens. However, women in Arm B who achieved complete pathological response had mean FDG-PET SUVmax reduction of 87.7% after four cycles, in contrast to those who had no or minor pathological response. These women recorded mean SUVmax reductions of only 27% (P &lt; 0.01). Women in Arm A showed no significant difference in SUVmax response according to pathological response. Sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and positive and negative predictive values were highest in women in Arm B.CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that SUVmax uptake by breast tumours during chemotherapy can be dependent on the drugs used. Care must be taken when interpreting FDG-PET in settings where patients receive varied drug protocols.</td><td>0                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    </td></tr>\n",

It is not known whether integration of capecitabine into an adjuvant regimen that contains a taxane, an anthracycline, and cyclophosphamide improves outcome in early breast cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Women with axillary node-positive or high-risk node-negative breast cancer were randomly assigned to receive either three cycles of docetaxel and capecitabine (TX) followed by three cycles of cyclophosphamide, epirubicin, and capecitabine (CEX; n = 753) or three cycles of docetaxel (T) followed by three cycles of cyclophosphamide, epirubicin, and fluorouracil (CEF; n = 747). The primary end point was recurrence-free survival (RFS). RESULTS: During a median follow-up time of 59 months, 214 RFS events occurred (local or distant recurrences or deaths; TX/CEX, n = 96; T/CEF, n = 118). RFS was not significantly different between the groups (hazard ratio [HR], 0.79; 95% CI, 0.60 to 1.04; P = .087; 5-year RFS, 86.6% for TX/CEX v 84.1% for T/CEF). Fifty-six patients assigned to TX/CEX died during the follow-up compared with 75 of patients assigned to T/CEF (HR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.52 to 1.04; P = .080). In exploratory analyses, TX/CEX improved breast cancer-specific survival (HR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.44 to 0.95; P = .027) and RFS in women with triple-negative disease and in women who had more than three metastatic axillary lymph nodes at the time of diagnosis. We detected little severe late toxicity. CONCLUSION: Integration of capecitabine into a regimen that contains docetaxel, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide did not improve RFS significantly compared with a similar regimen without capecitabine.</td><td>1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 </td></tr>\n",

Studies in animals have shown that responses to chemotherapy can be increased by dietary manipulation of tumour cell metabolism. Also dietary supplementation with the amino acid L-arginine, resulted in an increase in tumour metabolic activity expression of the nuclear activation antigen, Ki67, in patients with breast cancer. Therefore, we have carried out a randomised, double blind, placebo controlled trial to determine if L-arginine supplementation is beneficial in patients with breast cancer, undergoing neo-adjuvant chemotherapy. 96 patients were randomised to receive L-arginine (30 g/day) for three days (n = 48) or placebo (n = 48) prior to undergoing chemotherapy (doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, prednisolone), 6 pulses at 21-day intervals. Clinical and pathological responses were assessed in both groups of patients following completion of chemotherapy. The clinical response rate was 77% (23% complete and 54% partial responses) in the L-arginine treated group, compared with 71% (15% complete and 56% partial) in the placebo group of patients (p = ns). However, in patients with tumours less than 6 cm in initial diameter, there was a significant increase in the better histopathological responses in the L-arginine group, when compared with the placebo group of patients (88% vs 52%, p = 0.04). This may have important implications for clinical practice.</td><td>0                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    </td></tr>\n",

A total of 1146 patients were included: 311 high-risk node-negative premenopausal patients and 835 high-risk node-negative or node-positive postmenopausal patients. Patients were randomized after surgery to receive either no chemotherapy (control group) or 6 courses of anthracycline-based chemotherapy (CT group). Postmenopausal patients received adjuvant tamoxifen for at least two years. Radiotherapy was delivered after completion of chemotherapy in the CT group. The 10-year disease-free survival (DFS) rates were 60% in the control group and 65% in the CT group (log-rank test, p = 0.01). The 10-year distant metastasis rates were 28% and 23% (p = 0.02), and the 10-year local recurrence rates were 12% and 10%, respectively (p = 0.24). Chemotherapy was significantly less effective in post-menopausal patients with estrogen receptor-positive tumors. Adjuvant anthracycline-based chemotherapy yielded a significant benefit for DFS by lowering the risk of distant metastases. After up to 10 years of follow-up, deferring radiotherapy after chemotherapy did not compromise local control.</td><td>1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      </td></tr>\n",

METHODS: Healthy women (aged 55-85 y) with osteoporosis were enrolled in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial. Participants were randomized to treatment with bazedoxifene 20 or 40 mg, raloxifene 60 mg, or placebo daily for 3 years. Endometrial and ovarian safety was assessed by periodic transvaginal ultrasonography and endometrial biopsy through 24 months. Gynecologic and breast-related adverse events were recorded throughout the study. RESULTS: Among 753 participants with available transvaginal ultrasonography data, there were no significant between-group differences in overall endometrial thickness or in the percentage of participants with endometrial thickness greater than 5 mm at 12 or 24 months. Changes in the mean endometrial thickness (+/-SE) from baseline were -0.07 +/- 0.11 mm (bazedoxifene 20 mg), 0.10 +/- 0.11 mm (bazedoxifene 40 mg), 0.16 +/- 0.12 mm (raloxifene 60 mg), and -0.08 +/- 0.11 mm (placebo) at 24 months. There was one report of endometrial hyperplasia in each group, and there were zero, two, two, and three reports of endometrial carcinoma with bazedoxifene 20 and 40 mg, raloxifene 60 mg, and placebo, respectively. There were no clinically important changes from baseline in the number or size of ovarian cysts among groups. There was a significantly lower incidence of fibrocystic breast disease (P &lt;or= 0.05) with bazedoxifene compared with raloxifene 60 mg. CONCLUSION: Bazedoxifene was associated with a favorable endometrial, ovarian, and breast safety profile in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis.</td><td>0                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        </td></tr>\n",

Breast cancer can be subdivided according to standard pathological parameters including histological type, grade, and assessment of proliferation. These parameters are the net result of combinations of genetic alterations effecting tumour behaviour and could potentially reflect subtypes that respond differently to endocrine treatment. AIMS: To investigate the usefulness of these parameters as predictors of the response to tamoxifen in premenopausal women with breast cancer. MATERIALS/METHODS: Clinically established pathological parameters were assessed and related to the tamoxifen response in 500 available tumour specimens from 564 premenopausal patients with breast cancer randomised to either two years of tamoxifen or no treatment with 14 years of follow up. Proliferation was further evaluated by immunohistochemical Ki-67 expression. RESULTS: Oestrogen receptor positive ductal carcinomas responded as expected to tamoxifen, whereas the difference in recurrence free survival between control and tamoxifen treated patients was less apparent in the relatively few lobular carcinomas. For histological grade, there was no obvious difference in treatment response between the groups. The relation between proliferation and tamoxifen response seemed to be more complex, with a clear response in tumours with high and low proliferation, whereas tumours with intermediate proliferation defined by Ki-67 responded more poorly. CONCLUSIONS: Clinically established pathology parameters seem to mirror the endocrine treatment response and could potentially be valuable in future treatment decisions for patients with breast cancer.</td><td>0                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              </td></tr>\n",

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Nine hundred and twenty-six premenopausal patients with completely resected breast cancer and either axillary node involvement or histological grade 2 or 3 tumors were randomized after surgery to adjuvant chemotherapy alone (control arm) or adjuvant chemotherapy plus ovarian suppression (ovarian suppression arm). Ovarian suppression was obtained by either radiation-induced ovarian ablation or triptorelin for 3 years. The analyses were performed with Cox models stratified by center. RESULTS: Median follow-up was 9.5 years. Mean age was 43 years. Ninety per cent of patients had histologically proven positive axillary nodes, 63% positive hormonal receptors and 77% had received an anthracycline-based chemotherapy regimen. Ovarian suppression was by radiation-induced ovarian ablation (45% of patients) or with triptorelin (48%). At the time of randomization, all patients had regular menses or their follicle-stimulating hormone and estradiol levels indicated a premenopausal status. The 10-year disease-free survival rates were 49% [95% confidence interval (CI) 44% to 54%] in both arms (P = 0.51). The 10-year overall survival rates were 66% (95% CI 61% to 70%) for the ovarian suppression arm and 68% (95% CI 63% to 73%) for the control arm (P = 0.19). There were no variations in the treatment effect according to age, hormonal receptor status or ovarian suppression modality. However, in patients &lt;40 years of age and with estrogen receptor-positive tumors, ovarian suppression significantly decreased the risk of recurrence (P = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this trial, after at least 10 years of follow-up, do not favor the use of ovarian suppression after adjuvant chemotherapy. The potential beneficial effect in younger women with hormono-dependent tumors should be further assessed.</td><td>0                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      </td></tr>\n",

Women with unilateral, primary operable, estrogen receptor negative invasive breast cancer â‰¥ 2 cm were eligible for inclusion. Randomized patients were to receive four cycles of neoadjuvant EC plus 12 weeks of either gefitinib (250 mg daily) or placebo. Primary endpoint was pathologic complete response (pCR), and secondary endpoints were complete response (CR) and overall objective response (OR). 181 patients were randomized. A pCR was observed in 17% (12/71) of patients treated with gefitinib and in 12% (9/73) of patients treated with placebo (4.57% difference, 95% CI -7.19 to 6.33; P = 0.44). CR was observed in 10% of patients in both the gefitinib (7/71) and the placebo group (7/73) (0.27% difference, 95% CI -9.6 to 10.2; P = 0.96). There was no significant difference in OR (5.96%; 95% CI -9.9 to 21.9; P = 0.45) between the two groups. Post hoc subgroup analysis showed a significant difference in pCR between triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) and non-TNBC tumors (P = 0.03). More patients in the gefitinib arm had hematological toxicity (P = 0.15) and discontinued treatment (9/94 vs. 2/86) because of adverse events (AE). Tumor response rates were similar in the two groups. A significantly higher pCR rate was observed post hoc in TNBC versus non-TNBC independent of treatment. More patients in the gefitinib group discontinued treatment because of AE.</td><td>1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       </td></tr>\n",

However, not all breast cancer patients respond to aromatase inhibitors (AI), and many patients become unresponsive or relapse. Recent studies demonstrate that not only estrogens but also androgens may serve as regulators of estrogen-responsive as well as estrogen-unresponsive human breast cancers. However, the mechanism underlying these androgenic actions has remained relatively unknown. Therefore, in this study, we evaluated the effects of AI upon the expression of enzymes involved in intratumoral androgen production including 17Î²-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 5 (17Î²HSD5), 5Î±-reductase types 1 and 2 (5Î±Red1 and 5Î±Red2) as well as androgen receptor (AR) levels and correlated the findings with therapeutic responses including Ki67 labeling index (Ki67). Eighty-two postmenopausal invasive ductal carcinoma patients were enrolled in CAAN study from November 2001 to April 2004. Pre- and post-treatment specimens of 29 cases were available for this study. The status of 17Î²HSD5, 5Î±Red1, 5Î±Red2, and Ki67 in pre- and post-treatment specimens were evaluated. The significant increments of 5Î±Red2 as well as AR were detected in biological response group whose Ki67 LI decreased by more than 40% of the pre-treatment level. This is the first study demonstrating an increment of 5Î±Red2 and AR in the group of the patients associated with Ki67 decrement following AI treatment. These results suggest that increased 5Î±Red2 and AR following AI treatment may partly contribute to reduce the tumor cell proliferation through increasing intratumoral androgen concentrations and its receptor.</td><td>0                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  </td></tr>\n",

The clinical benefits of adjuvant trastuzumab have been demonstrated in interim analyses of four large trials. Initial data of the combined analysis of the North Central Cancer Treatment Group (NCCTG) N9831 Intergroup trial and National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP) B-31 trial were reported in 2005. Long-term follow-up results on disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) have been awaited. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with HER2-positive operable breast cancer were randomly assigned to doxorubicin plus cyclophosphamide followed by paclitaxel with or without trastuzumab in the NCCTG N9831 and NSABP B-31 trials. The similar design of both trials allowed data from the control and trastuzumab-containing arms to be combined in a joint analysis. RESULTS: At 3.9 years of median follow-up, there continues to be a highly statistically significant reduction in DFS event rate in favor of the trastuzumab-containing arm (P &lt; .001). Similarly, there continues to be a statistically significant 39% reduction in death rate in favor of the trastuzumab-containing arm (P &lt; .001). CONCLUSION: These data demonstrate consistent DFS and OS advantages of adjuvant trastuzumab over time, with the longest follow-up reported to date. The clinical benefits continue to outweigh the risks of adverse effects.</td><td>0                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             </td></tr>\n",

METHODS: Ipsilateral lymph nodes (negative for metastases by routine histology) from 736 patients (participants in Trial V of the International [Ludwig] Breast Cancer Study) were examined by serial sectioning and staining with haematoxylin and eosin (two sections from each of six levels) and by immunohistochemistry of a single section (with two anticytokeratins AE-1 and CAM 5.2). After median follow-up of 12 years, disease-free and overall survival were estimated by Kaplan-Meier methods. FINDINGS: Occult nodal metastases were detected by serial sectioning and haematoxylin and eosin in 52 (7%) of 736 patients and by immunohistochemistry in 148 (20%). Only two (3%) of 64 invasive lobular or mixed invasive lobular and ductal cancers had node micrometastases, detected by haematoxylin and eosin, compared with 25 (39%) by immunohistochemistry. Occult metastases, detected by either method, were associated with significantly poor disease-free and overall survival in postmenopausal but not in premenopausal patients. Immunohistochemically detected occult lymph-node metastases remained an independent and highly significant predictor of recurrence even after control for tumour grade, tumour size, oestrogen-receptor status, vascular invasion, and treatment assignment (hazard ratio 1.79 [95% CI 1.17-2.74], p=0.007). INTERPRETATION: The immunohistochemical examination of ipsilateral axillary lymph nodes is a reliable, prognostically valuable, and simple method for the detection of occult nodal metastases. Immunohistochemistry is recommended as a standard method of node examination in postmenopausal patients.</td><td>0                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          </td></tr>\n",

Expression of STn in colon and ovarian cancer is associated with a poor prognosis independent of tumour grade, stage or histological type. We have examined 237 cases of primary breast cancer for expression of this antigen using the antibody HB-STn (Dako). The frequency of STn expression was 31% in the whole group, 36% in the node-negative and 28% in the node-positive group. Survival was lower, but not significantly so, in the STn-positive group (P = 0.07), but this effect was highly significant for patients with node-positive disease (P &lt; 0.002), the curves for node-negative disease being coincident (P = 0.31). In node-positive disease the effect was limited to those receiving adjuvant chemotherapy (P = 0.001). In a multivariate (Cox) analysis on the whole group STn staining, combined with adjuvant chemotherapy, showed a highly significant correlation with survival. In STn-negative cases, adjuvant chemotherapy improved survival (relative risk 2.3, 95% confidence intervals 1.4-3.9), whereas adjuvant chemotherapy did not influence survival in patients which expressed STn (relative risk 1.1, 95% confidence intervals 0.6-2.2). Thus, by either direct or indirect mechanisms, STn positivity appears to be a marker of resistance to adjuvant chemotherapy.</td><td>0                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               </td></tr>\n",

This post-hoc analysis addressed whether: (1) these prognostic factors can identify a low-risk group for whom ondansetron plus dexamethasone alone provide a high level of protection (â‰¥80% no emesis); (2) the NK1 receptor antagonist aprepitant improves antiemetic outcome regardless of emetic risk. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Breast cancer patients in a phase III double-blind, placebo-controlled trial were randomized to antiemetic regimens including ondansetron and dexamethasone, or aprepitant, ondansetron, and dexamethasone. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to assess the impact on emesis (but not nausea) of the regimen with aprepitant, and previously reported risk factors, including age (&lt;55 and â‰¥55 years), ethanol use (0-4 or â‰¥5 drinks/week), history of pregnancy-related morning sickness, and history of motion sickness, using a modified intent-to-treat approach. RESULTS: Treatment with aprepitant (Pâ€‰&lt;â€‰0.0001), older age (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.006), ethanol use (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.0048), and no history of morning sickness (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.0007) were all significantly associated with reduced likelihood of emesis. The proportion of patients with one, two, or three risk factors who remained emesis free was significantly higher with the aprepitant-containing regimen than with the active control (70.2-82.8% vs. 38.6-66.4%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Aprepitant markedly improved control of emesis in patients with one or more risk factors. This analysis did not support using risk factors for modifying the antiemetic approach. A low-risk group with zero risk factors for whom aprepitant provided little benefit was of questionable clinical utility, since they comprised less than 3% of patients.</td><td>0                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    </td></tr>\n",

Tamoxifen has been shown to decrease the risk of invasive breast cancer and decrease breast density. We sought to demonstrate and calculate the extent of change in mammographic density in women who have taken tamoxifen for up to 2 years. We evaluated mammograms from 28 high-risk women who were taking tamoxifen. Four different methods of evaluation were used: (a) two qualitative methods (Wolfe criteria and the American College of Radiology Breast Imaging and Reporting Data System criteria); (b) one semiquantitative method (mammograms were assigned one of five semiquantitative scores by visual inspection); and (c) one quantitative method (computer-aided calculation of fibroglandular area from digitized mammograms). The Wolfe criteria showed a 0.03 category decrease per year (P = 0.50). The American College of Radiology Breast Imaging and Reporting Data System criteria showed a 0.1 category decrease per year (P = 0.12). Semiquantitative criteria showed a 0.2 category decrease per year (P = 0.039). Digitized scores showed a 4.3% decrease per year (P = 0.0007). In conclusion, tamoxifen causes a decrease in mammographic density with use, an effect that is better quantitated with semiquantitative criteria or digitized images. Density change might become useful as a surrogate end point for the effect of tamoxifen and other chemopreventive measures, although our data do not predict an individual's degree of risk reduction.</td><td>0                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               </td></tr>\n",

The drug was given orally at a dose of 30-35 mg/m2 every 3 weeks. Twenty-two patients were evaluable for response. All evaluable patients were previously treated with one or more chemotherapeutic regimens, including an anthracycline in more than 50% of the cases. Partial remissions were obtained in 5 patients, for a response rate of 23%. The median duration of response was 191 days. Mild nausea and vomiting were common. Diarrhea, which occurred in less than 50% of the patients, was usually short-lived. Alopecia was generally minimal. Myelosuppression was the dose-limiting toxic effect. Leukopenia was frequently seen, with full recovery by day 28 in 81% of the courses. Thrombocytopenia was less common than leukopenia. Four cases of grade 1 acute cardiac toxicity were recorded. This study suggests that idarubicin can induce regressions in advanced carcinoma of the breast, and justifies further studies in combination with other agents.</td><td>1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              </td></tr>\n",

This may be due to endocrine therapy suppressing cell division, in hormone-dependent tumors, whereas chemotherapy acts mainly on active-dividing cells. A trial protocol has therefore been devised which seeks to exploit the properties of both types of therapy. Oestrogen suppression is first obtained by aminoglutethimide (Orimeten) plus hydrocortisone; after 2 weeks, ethinyloestradiol is given to induce cell division and followed 24 h later by a combination of 3 cytotoxic agents given intravenously. This pattern of therapy, repeated at regular intervals, appears to be producing favorable clinical results. A phase-III study is being started among patients with hormone-dependent advanced breast cancer.</td><td>1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              </td></tr>\n",

The therapeutic regimen consisted of a combination of cisplatin 100 mg/m2, given as a 24-hr infusion on day 1 and vindesine (VDS) 2 mg/m2, i.v. bolus on days 1 and 8. VDS injection was omitted on day 8 in patients with poor bone marrow reserves (prior extensive irradiation). Courses were repeated at 4-week intervals until documented disease progression. Among 46 evaluable patients, there were two complete and seven partial remissions for an overall response rate of 20%. These responses lasted for a median of 21 weeks (range 8-89 weeks). Remission rates according to the predominant metastatic site were as follows: soft tissue, 3/8 (38%); bone, 0/6 (0%); viscera, 6/32 (19%). Transient myelosuppression and gastrointestinal intolerance were almost universal. Renal function impairment and neurologic manifestations were frequently encountered but these adverse reactions were generally mild. Significant antineoplastic activity in far-advanced and heavily pretreated patients warrants further evaluation of this regimen at an earlier stage of the disease.</td><td>1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             </td></tr>\n",

Ten of 19 patients (53%) responded to primary tamoxifen therapy and six of 24 (25%) responded to primary estrogen therapy. Crossover responses were observed in seven of 19 (37%) on the secondary tamoxifen therapy and in two of 10 (20%) on secondary estrogen therapy, and were not related to the response to the primary hormonal maneuver. Responses were related to the presence of estrogen receptor protein (ERP), particularly for tamoxifen therapy, although responses were observed in three of six ERP negative patients receiving estrogen and in seven of 25 (28%) of patients with an unknown ERP status. Complications were observed in 35 instances with estrogen therapy and in only five instances with tamoxifen therapy. Initial hormonal therapy with tamoxifen in postmenopausal patients with advanced breast cancer and ERP status positive or unknown is superior to primary estrogen treatment. Secondary therapy and response to estrogen or tamoxifen is not necessarily predicted by the initial hormone response, and crossover to the alternative therapy is generally indicated.</td><td>1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             </td></tr>\n",

Twenty-six received high doses of medroxyprogesterone before entering this study. There was no significant difference in patients' characteristics with or without medroxyprogesterone pretreatment. A comparison of patients with and without prior medroxyprogesterone shows a significant difference in the response rate to aminoglutethimide-hydrocortisone (4 vs 32%, P = 0.02). In patients pretreated with tamoxifen but not with medroxyprogesterone the response rate to aminoglutethimide was 36%. These results suggest that aminoglutethimide has a low activity in breast cancer patients previously exposed to medroxyprogesterone, an agent with glucocorticoid-like activity inducing adrenal suppression.</td><td>1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             </td></tr>\n",

Treatment duration was 4-21 weeks in schedule 1 and 6-24 weeks (2-8 courses) in schedule 2. Regressions were not achieved with either schedule. Treatment was associated with significant toxicity and was more severe in schedule 2. Dose limiting toxicities were leukopenia, elevation of liver enzymes, hyperglycemia and fatigue. Serum IFN activity was low or undetectable in patients on schedule 1 and high in patients on schedule 2. At 24 h, serum IFN activity was detectable in only 1/6 patients on schedule 1 as compared to 3/7 patients on schedule 2. IFN neutralizing factors were detected in the serum of only 1 patient prior to treatment but none were detected in any of the patients during or after discontinuation of treatment (4-24 weeks). IFN alpha 2 increased the expression of both HLA class 1 antigens and beta 2 microglobulin in peripheral blood lymphocytes in vivo.

Thirteen patients are evaluable for response and toxicity. Partial remission was seen in six patients, with soft tissue, bone and visceral metastases and static disease in a further four patients. Median duration of response has not yet been reached (8+ months). Toxicity was mild and predictable, with no patient experiencing severe nausea and vomiting, and only four of the patients requiring a wig for alopecia. Malaise and lethargy were common in those patients receiving more than three courses, and an increase in the mean corpuscular volume (MCV) together with a fall in haemoglobin were seen in patients receiving multiple courses of treatment. The study suggests that this combination is active, and may prove useful with other agents in the treatment of breast cancer.</td><td>1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       </td></tr>\n",

The mean serum MTX level immediately prior to 5-FU administration was 1.37 mumols/L (1.37 X 10(-6) M). Of 29 evaluable patients with breast cancer (six of whom had received prior chemotherapy), one achieved a complete response and five achieved a partial response (total response rate, 21%). Among 16 evaluable patients with colorectal cancer (three of whom had received prior chemotherapy), there were no objective responses. Although hematologic toxicity was generally mild, mucositis occurred in 20 patients (severe in three), and at least one early death was attributable to toxicity. These results indicate that at doses of MTX and 5-FU which are in general use in combination chemotherapy for breast cancer, sequential treatment does not have a therapeutic advantage.

Side effects in the medical group were minimal while surgical complications included 2 cases of CSF rhinorrhea, one leading to meningitis and death. In patients receiving aminoglutethimide, urinary free cortisol and plasma dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate fell significantly as did plasma estrone and estradiol. In the hypophysectomy group, anterior-pituitary function testing postoperatively revealed adequate suppression of gonadotropin and prolactin secretion but incomplete inhibition of the ACTH-cortisol axis in 4 of 7 surgical patients studied. Five patients initially treated with hypophysectomy experienced a further reduction of plasma (and urinary) estrone and estradiol levels when given aminoglutethimide. We conclude that estrogen suppression therapy with aminoglutethimide is a feasible alternative to surgical hypophysectomy in providing endocrine suppression and palliation in advanced breast carcinoma.</td><td>0                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        </td></tr>\n",

Seven cases were non-metastasising infiltrating duct carcinoma of breast and 6 cases were non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL).

The patients who showed a negative skin test and a T-cell population less than 40\\% were further subjected to assessment of T-cell population and activity after appropriate therapy, and clinical cure of the disease. It was observed that 2 out of 3 cases (66.66\\%) of squamous cell carcinomas, 2 out of 2 cases (100\\%) of adenocarcinomas and one out of 3 cases (33.33\\%) of NHL showed positive conversion with a T-cell population of more than 40\\%. & 0                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \\\\\n",

We compared the response of nonresponding patients who continued the same treatment with that of patients who switched to a well-tolerated non-cross-resistant regimen. METHODS: Previously untreated breast cancer patients received two 3-week cycles of docetaxel at 75 mg/m(2), doxorubicin at 50 mg/m(2), and cyclophosphamide at 500 mg/m(2) per day (TAC). Patients whose tumors did not decrease in size by at least 50\\% were randomly assigned to four additional cycles of TAC or to four cycles of vinorelbine at 25 mg/m(2) and capecitabine at 2000 mg/m(2) (NX). The outcome was sonographic response, defined as a reduction in the product of the two largest perpendicular diameters by at least 50\\%. A difference of 10\\% or less in the sonographic response qualified as noninferiority of the NX treatment. Pathological complete response was defined as no invasive or in situ residual tumor masses in the breast and lymph nodes. Toxic effects were assessed. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: Of 2090 patients enrolled in the GeparTrio study, 622 (29.8\\%) who did not respond to two initial cycles of TAC were randomly assigned to an additional four cycles of TAC (n = 321) or to four cycles of NX (n = 301). Sonographic response rate was 50.5\\% for the TAC arm and 51.2\\% for the NX arm. The difference of 0.7\\% (95\\% confidence interval = -7.1\\% to 8.5\\%) demonstrated noninferiority of NX (P = .008). Similar numbers of patients in both arms received breast-conserving surgery (184 {[}57.3\\%{]} in the TAC arm vs 180 {[}59.8\\%{]} in the NX arm) and had a pathological complete response (5.3\\% vs 6.0\\%). Fewer patients in the NX arm than in the TAC arm had hematologic toxic effects, mucositis, infections, and nail changes, but more had hand-foot syndrome and sensory neuropathy. CONCLUSION: Pathological complete responses to both regimens were marginal. Among patients who did not respond to the initial neoadjuvant TAC treatment, similar efficacy but better tolerability was observed by switching to NX than continuing with TAC. & 1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \\\\\n",

The primary endpoint of study-5-year disease-free survival (DFS)-was assessed by Kaplan-Meier analysis. Secondary endpoints included overall survival and analysis of the prognostic and predictive value of clinical and molecular (hormone receptors by immunohistochemistry and HER2 by fluorescence in situ hybridization) markers. Associations and interactions were assessed with a multivariable Cox proportional hazards model for DFS for the following covariates: age, menopausal status, tumor size, lymph node status, type of chemotherapy, tumor size, positive lymph nodes, HER2 status, and hormone receptor status. All statistical tests were two-sided.RESULTS: Among the 1246 eligible patients, estimated rates of DFS at 5 years were 78.5\\% in the FEC-P arm and 72.1\\% in the FEC arm (difference = 6.4\\%, 95\\% confidence interval {[}CI{]} = 1.6\\% to 11.2\\%; P = .006). FEC-P treatment was associated with a 23\\% reduction in the risk of relapse compared with FEC treatment (146 relapses in the 614 patients in the FEC-P arm vs 193 relapses in the 632 patients in the FEC arm, hazard ratio {[}HR{]} = 0.77, 95\\% CI = 0.62 to 0.95; P = .022) and a 22\\% reduction in the risk of death (73 and 95 deaths, respectively, HR = 0.78, 95\\% CI = 0.57 to 1.06; P = .110). Among the 928 patients for whom tumor samples were centrally analyzed, type of chemotherapy (FEC vs FEC-P) (P = .017), number of involved axillary lymph nodes (P < .001), tumor size (P = .020), hormone receptor status (P = .004), and HER2 status (P = .006) were all associated with DFS.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 260 women with measurable metastatic breast cancer fulfilling high-risk criteria, previously untreated with chemotherapy for their metastatic disease, were randomized to receive either mitoxantrone 12 mg/m(2) or the combination of fluorouracil 500 mg/m(2), epirubicin 50 mg/m(2) and cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m(2) (FEC) every 3 weeks. Treatment was continued until complete remission plus two cycles, or until disease progression. In the case of partial remission or stable disease, treatment was stopped after 12 cycles. Second-line treatment was vindesine, mitomycin and prednisolone. Gain from treatment was estimated using a modified Brunner's score composed of time to progression, patients' rating of the treatment benefit, alopecia, vomiting and performance status. RESULTS: After recruitment from 1992 to 1997 and observation from 1997 to 1999, the final evaluation showed that single-agent treatment with mitoxantrone does not differ significantly from combination treatment with FEC in terms of response, objective remission rate, remission duration, time to response, time to best response, time to progression or overall survival. There was, however, a significant difference in gain from treatment using a modified Brunner's score favoring the single-agent treatment arm. There was no evidence that any subgroup would fare better with combination treatment. CONCLUSIONS: No significant difference was detected between the treatment with mitoxantrone as a single agent and the combination of low-dose FEC in terms of response or survival; therefore, the imperative of the necessity of first-line combination chemotherapy for patients with high-risk metastatic breast cancer may be questioned. Since toxicity and quality of life score favored the single-agent mitoxantrone treatment arm, this treatment may be offered to patients preferring quality of life to a potential small prolongation of survival. & 1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \\\\\n",

Expression of Bcl-2 was determined using immunohistochemistry on paraffin-embedded sections in a series of 441 premenopausal, lymph node-negative breast cancers of patients randomised to receive perioperative chemotherapy (5-fluorouracil, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide) or no perioperative chemotherapy. Immunohistochemistry of Bcl-2 was evaluated by scoring both staining intensity (0-3) and number of positive cells (0-2). Using these scores tumours were grouped into categories 0-6. It was found that 9.2\\% of the tumours were completely negative (0), 17.2\\% weakly (1 + 2), 41.6\\% moderately (3 + 4) and 31.9\\% strongly positive (5 + 6) for Bcl-2. A positive correlation was found between high Bcl-2 expression and oestrogen (P < 0.001) and progesterone receptor positivity (P < 0.001) and low tumour grade (P < 0.001), whereas high Bcl-2 expression was negatively correlated with p53 (P < 0.001) and c-erb-B-2 positively (P < 0.001), high Ki-67 index (P < 0.001), mitotic index (P < 0.001) and large tumour size (P = 0.006). Patients with tumours expressing high levels of Bcl-2 (overall score 3-6) had a significantly better disease-free (P = 0.004) and overall (P = 0.009) survival. However, in a multivariate model this association no longer remained significant. There was a trend for an effect of adjuvant chemotherapy on disease-free survival both for patients with Bcl-2-positive (HR-0.61, 95\\% CI 0.35-1.06, P = 0.07) and negative (HR = 0.55, 95\\% CI 0.27-1.12, P = 0.09) breast tumours at a median follow-up of 49 months. The level of Bcl-2 expression does not seem to predict response to perioperative chemotherapy in premenopausal, lymph node-negative breast cancer patients. High levels of Bcl-2 are preferentially expressed in well-differentiated tumours and are associated with favourable prognosis. However, Bcl-2 expression is not an independent prognostic factor in this patient series. & 0                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \\\\\n",

Both agents are highly active as monotherapy in a number of tumors, including metastatic breast cancer. Therefore, we performed a phase I dose-finding study to determine the maximum tolerated dose of this combination regimen in patients with advanced solid tumors. A total of 45 patients were enrolled and received cyclophosphamide followed by docetaxel, both administered as 1-hour intravenous infusions once every 3 weeks. The dose levels of cyclophosphamide/docetaxel were 600/60 mg/m2 (group 0), 600/75 mg/m2 (group I), 700/75 mg/m2 (group 2), 800/75 mg/m2 (group 3), 800/85 mg/m2 (group 4), 800/75 mg/m2 (group 5), and 800/85 mg/m2 (group 6). Patients with dose-limiting neutropenia in groups 5 and 6 received 300 micrograms of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) (filgrastim {[}Neupogen{]}) support on days 2 through 9 during subsequent cycles of chemotherapy. All patients received premedication with 8 mg of dexamethasone twice daily for 5 days, beginning 1 day prior to chemotherapy. The dose-limiting toxicity was neutropenia fever. The recommended dose for phase II studies of cyclophosphamide/docetaxel is 700/75 mg/m2 in previously treated patients and 800/75 mg/m2 in previously untreated patients. G-CSF support did not allow for further dose escalation. Preliminary results from this phase I trial indicate that the combination of docetaxel and cyclophosphamide produced an objective response rate of 69\\% in 32 patients with metastatic breast cancer (including 3 patients who achieved complete responses). & 1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \\\\\n",

Aromatase inhibitors (AIs) are increasingly used after initial tamoxifen in the adjuvant treatment of postmenopausal early breast cancer due to their mechanism of action: a potential benefit being a reduction of uterine abnormalities caused by tamoxifen.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sonographic uterine effects of the steroidal AI exemestane were studied in 219 women participating in the Intergroup Exemestane Study: a large trial in postmenopausal women with estrogen receptor-positive (or unknown) early breast cancer, disease free after 2-3 years of tamoxifen, randomly assigned to continue tamoxifen or switch to exemestane to complete 5 years adjuvant treatment. The primary end point was the proportion of patients with abnormal (> or =5 mm) endometrial thickness (ET) on transvaginal ultrasound 24 months after randomisation.RESULTS: The analysis included 183 patients. Two years after randomisation, the proportion of patients with abnormal ET was significantly lower in the exemestane compared with tamoxifen arm (36\\% versus 62\\%, respectively; P = 0.004). This difference emerged within 6 months of switching treatment (43.5\\% versus 65.2\\%, respectively; P = 0.01) and disappeared within 12 months of treatment completion (30.8\\% versus 34.7\\%, respectively; P = 0.67).CONCLUSION: Switching from tamoxifen to exemestane significantly reverses endometrial thickening associated with continued tamoxifen. & 0                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \\\\\n",

However, whether the same benefits apply also in postmenopausal women treated with adjuvant tamoxifen for similar high-risk cancer is unclear. In a randomised trial among postmenopausal women who had undergone mastectomy, we compared adjuvant tamoxifen alone with tamoxifen plus postoperative radiotherapy. METHODS: Between 1982 and 1990, postmenopausal women with high-risk breast cancer (stage II or III) were randomly assigned adjuvant tamoxifen (30 mg daily for 1 year) alone (689) or with postoperative radiotherapy to the chest wall and regional lymph nodes (686). Median follow-up was 123 months. The endpoints were first site of recurrence (locoregional recurrence, distant metastases, or both), and disease-free and overall survival. FINDINGS: Locoregional recurrence occurred in 52 (8\\%) of the radiotherapy plus tamoxifen group and 242 (35\\%) of the tamoxifen only group (p<0.001). In total there were 321 (47\\%) and 411 (60\\%) recurrences, respectively. Disease-free survival was 36\\% in the radiotherapy plus tamoxifen group and 24\\% in the tamoxifen alone group (p<0.001). Overall survival was also higher in the radiotherapy group (385 vs 434 deaths; survival 45 vs 36\\% at 10 years, p=0.03). INTERPRETATION: Postoperative radiotherapy decreased the risk of locoregional recurrence and was associated with improved survival in high-risk postmenopausal breast-cancer patients after mastectomy and limited axillary dissection, with 1 year of adjuvant tamoxifen treatment. Improved survival in high-risk breast cancer can best be achieved by a strategy of both locoregional and systemic tumour control. & 0                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \\\\\n",

The primary study endpoint was the provider-assessed maximal grade of Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 3.0, radiation dermatitis. The secondary endpoints included provider-assessed Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Grade 3 or greater radiation dermatitis and adverse event monitoring. The patient-reported outcome measures included the Skindex-16, the Skin Toxicity Assessment Tool, a Symptom Experience Diary, and a quality-of-life self-assessment. An assessment was performed at baseline, weekly during radiotherapy, and for 2 weeks after radiotherapy.RESULTS: A total of 176 patients were enrolled between September 21, 2007, and December 7, 2007. The provider-assessed primary endpoint showed no difference in the mean maximum grade of radiation dermatitis by treatment arm (1.2 for MMF vs. 1.3 for placebo; p = .18). Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events toxicity was greater in the placebo group (p = .04), primarily from pruritus. For the patient-reported outcome measures, the maximum Skindex-16 score for the MMF group showed less itching (p = .008), less irritation (p = .01), less symptom persistence or recurrence (p = .02), and less annoyance with skin problems (p = .04). The group's maximal Skin Toxicity Assessment Tool score showed less burning sensation (p = .02) and less itching (p = .002).CONCLUSION: Patients receiving daily MMF during radiotherapy might experience reduced acute skin toxicity compared with patients receiving placebo. & 0                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \\\\\n",

A controlled trial of 128 patients showed that in a variety of recurrent cases the addition of warfarin to chemotherapy doubled the 2-year survival rate. The best results were obtained in postmenopausal patients with breast cancer. Warfarin depresses cellular immune responses which might militate against its use for cases undergoing \"curative\" surgery. Instead, induction of fibrinolysis by streptokinase or Brinase is suggested, because it increases the activity of the cellular immune mechanism. The results to date of an ongoing controlled randomized trial of streptokinase with surgery of tumors of the large bowel are presented, showing that the trends are in favor of streptokinase therapy; however, insufficient time has elapsed to make it, as yet, statistically significant. The action of streptokinase-induced plasmin and Brinase on lymphocytes is described. & 0                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \\\\\n",

We performed a randomised Phase II study to assess the safety and relative toxicity of AC (doxorubicin; cyclophosphamide) vs E(epirubicin)C given by conventional or accelerated schedules as neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy for early breast cancer. Furthermore, the relative toxicity of doxorubicin and epirubicin remains uncertain. Patients were randomised to one of four arms; four courses of standard 3 weekly cyclophosphamide 600 mg m(-2) in combination with doxorubicin 60 mg m(-2) (AC) vs epirubicin 90 mg m(-2) (EC) 3 weekly vs the same regimens administered every 2 weeks with pegfilgrastim (G-CSF). A total of 126 patients were treated, 42 with standard AC, 42 with accelerated AC, 19 with standard EC and 23 with accelerated EC. Significantly more grade 3/4 day one neutropenia was seen with standard (6/61, 10\\%) compared to accelerated (0/65,) regimens (P=0.01). A trend towards more neutropenic sepsis was seen in the combined standard and accelerated AC arms (12/84, 14\\%) compared to the combined EC arms (1/42, 2\\%), P=0.06. Falls in left ventricular ejection fraction were not increased with accelerated treatment. Accelerated AC and EC with pegfilgrastim are safe and feasible regimens in the treatment of early breast cancer with less neutropenia than conventional 3 weekly schedules. & 1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \\\\\n",

The survival for patients with advanced HCC is extremely poor. This is largely attributed to the lack of effective screening methods, advanced stage at presentation, limited utility of surgical intervention and ineffective medical therapy. Over the past 30 years, many conventional cytotoxic agents have been tested and have failed to confer a survival benefit. Recently, sorafenib, a multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitor, was approved by the US FDA as first-line therapy in HCC as the first agent demonstrating survival benefit in this disease. Although the survival benefit demonstrated by sorafenib is moderate, molecular targeted therapy has brought new hope in the management of HCC. & 0                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \\\\\n",

Tumour response to chemotherapy was evaluated based on histology from a surgical specimen collected upon completion of chemotherapy.RESULTS: Sixty women were enrolled into the study. Thirty-one received docetaxel followed by anthracyclines (Arm A) and 29 received drugs in the reverse order (Arm B). Most women (83\\%) had ductal carcinoma and 10 women (17\\%) had lobular or lobular/ductal carcinoma. All but one tumour were downstaged during therapy. Overall, there was no significant difference in response between the two drug regimens. However, women in Arm B who achieved complete pathological response had mean FDG-PET SUVmax reduction of 87.7\\% after four cycles, in contrast to those who had no or minor pathological response. These women recorded mean SUVmax reductions of only 27\\% (P < 0.01). Women in Arm A showed no significant difference in SUVmax response according to pathological response. Sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and positive and negative predictive values were highest in women in Arm B.CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that SUVmax uptake by breast tumours during chemotherapy can be dependent on the drugs used. Care must be taken when interpreting FDG-PET in settings where patients receive varied drug protocols. & 0                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \\\\\n",

It is not known whether integration of capecitabine into an adjuvant regimen that contains a taxane, an anthracycline, and cyclophosphamide improves outcome in early breast cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Women with axillary node-positive or high-risk node-negative breast cancer were randomly assigned to receive either three cycles of docetaxel and capecitabine (TX) followed by three cycles of cyclophosphamide, epirubicin, and capecitabine (CEX; n = 753) or three cycles of docetaxel (T) followed by three cycles of cyclophosphamide, epirubicin, and fluorouracil (CEF; n = 747). The primary end point was recurrence-free survival (RFS). RESULTS: During a median follow-up time of 59 months, 214 RFS events occurred (local or distant recurrences or deaths; TX/CEX, n = 96; T/CEF, n = 118). RFS was not significantly different between the groups (hazard ratio {[}HR{]}, 0.79; 95\\% CI, 0.60 to 1.04; P = .087; 5-year RFS, 86.6\\% for TX/CEX v 84.1\\% for T/CEF). Fifty-six patients assigned to TX/CEX died during the follow-up compared with 75 of patients assigned to T/CEF (HR, 0.73; 95\\% CI, 0.52 to 1.04; P = .080). In exploratory analyses, TX/CEX improved breast cancer-specific survival (HR, 0.64; 95\\% CI, 0.44 to 0.95; P = .027) and RFS in women with triple-negative disease and in women who had more than three metastatic axillary lymph nodes at the time of diagnosis. We detected little severe late toxicity. CONCLUSION: Integration of capecitabine into a regimen that contains docetaxel, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide did not improve RFS significantly compared with a similar regimen without capecitabine. & 1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \\\\\n",

Studies in animals have shown that responses to chemotherapy can be increased by dietary manipulation of tumour cell metabolism. Also dietary supplementation with the amino acid L-arginine, resulted in an increase in tumour metabolic activity expression of the nuclear activation antigen, Ki67, in patients with breast cancer. Therefore, we have carried out a randomised, double blind, placebo controlled trial to determine if L-arginine supplementation is beneficial in patients with breast cancer, undergoing neo-adjuvant chemotherapy. 96 patients were randomised to receive L-arginine (30 g/day) for three days (n = 48) or placebo (n = 48) prior to undergoing chemotherapy (doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, prednisolone), 6 pulses at 21-day intervals. Clinical and pathological responses were assessed in both groups of patients following completion of chemotherapy. The clinical response rate was 77\\% (23\\% complete and 54\\% partial responses) in the L-arginine treated group, compared with 71\\% (15\\% complete and 56\\% partial) in the placebo group of patients (p = ns). However, in patients with tumours less than 6 cm in initial diameter, there was a significant increase in the better histopathological responses in the L-arginine group, when compared with the placebo group of patients (88\\% vs 52\\%, p = 0.04). This may have important implications for clinical practice. & 0                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \\\\\n",

A total of 1146 patients were included: 311 high-risk node-negative premenopausal patients and 835 high-risk node-negative or node-positive postmenopausal patients. Patients were randomized after surgery to receive either no chemotherapy (control group) or 6 courses of anthracycline-based chemotherapy (CT group). Postmenopausal patients received adjuvant tamoxifen for at least two years. Radiotherapy was delivered after completion of chemotherapy in the CT group. The 10-year disease-free survival (DFS) rates were 60\\% in the control group and 65\\% in the CT group (log-rank test, p = 0.01). The 10-year distant metastasis rates were 28\\% and 23\\% (p = 0.02), and the 10-year local recurrence rates were 12\\% and 10\\%, respectively (p = 0.24). Chemotherapy was significantly less effective in post-menopausal patients with estrogen receptor-positive tumors. Adjuvant anthracycline-based chemotherapy yielded a significant benefit for DFS by lowering the risk of distant metastases. After up to 10 years of follow-up, deferring radiotherapy after chemotherapy did not compromise local control. & 1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \\\\\n",

METHODS: Healthy women (aged 55-85 y) with osteoporosis were enrolled in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial. Participants were randomized to treatment with bazedoxifene 20 or 40 mg, raloxifene 60 mg, or placebo daily for 3 years. Endometrial and ovarian safety was assessed by periodic transvaginal ultrasonography and endometrial biopsy through 24 months. Gynecologic and breast-related adverse events were recorded throughout the study. RESULTS: Among 753 participants with available transvaginal ultrasonography data, there were no significant between-group differences in overall endometrial thickness or in the percentage of participants with endometrial thickness greater than 5 mm at 12 or 24 months. Changes in the mean endometrial thickness (+/-SE) from baseline were -0.07 +/- 0.11 mm (bazedoxifene 20 mg), 0.10 +/- 0.11 mm (bazedoxifene 40 mg), 0.16 +/- 0.12 mm (raloxifene 60 mg), and -0.08 +/- 0.11 mm (placebo) at 24 months. There was one report of endometrial hyperplasia in each group, and there were zero, two, two, and three reports of endometrial carcinoma with bazedoxifene 20 and 40 mg, raloxifene 60 mg, and placebo, respectively. There were no clinically important changes from baseline in the number or size of ovarian cysts among groups. There was a significantly lower incidence of fibrocystic breast disease (P <or= 0.05) with bazedoxifene compared with raloxifene 60 mg. CONCLUSION: Bazedoxifene was associated with a favorable endometrial, ovarian, and breast safety profile in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. & 0                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \\\\\n",

Breast cancer can be subdivided according to standard pathological parameters including histological type, grade, and assessment of proliferation. These parameters are the net result of combinations of genetic alterations effecting tumour behaviour and could potentially reflect subtypes that respond differently to endocrine treatment. AIMS: To investigate the usefulness of these parameters as predictors of the response to tamoxifen in premenopausal women with breast cancer. MATERIALS/METHODS: Clinically established pathological parameters were assessed and related to the tamoxifen response in 500 available tumour specimens from 564 premenopausal patients with breast cancer randomised to either two years of tamoxifen or no treatment with 14 years of follow up. Proliferation was further evaluated by immunohistochemical Ki-67 expression. RESULTS: Oestrogen receptor positive ductal carcinomas responded as expected to tamoxifen, whereas the difference in recurrence free survival between control and tamoxifen treated patients was less apparent in the relatively few lobular carcinomas. For histological grade, there was no obvious difference in treatment response between the groups. The relation between proliferation and tamoxifen response seemed to be more complex, with a clear response in tumours with high and low proliferation, whereas tumours with intermediate proliferation defined by Ki-67 responded more poorly. CONCLUSIONS: Clinically established pathology parameters seem to mirror the endocrine treatment response and could potentially be valuable in future treatment decisions for patients with breast cancer. & 0                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \\\\\n",

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Nine hundred and twenty-six premenopausal patients with completely resected breast cancer and either axillary node involvement or histological grade 2 or 3 tumors were randomized after surgery to adjuvant chemotherapy alone (control arm) or adjuvant chemotherapy plus ovarian suppression (ovarian suppression arm). Ovarian suppression was obtained by either radiation-induced ovarian ablation or triptorelin for 3 years. The analyses were performed with Cox models stratified by center. RESULTS: Median follow-up was 9.5 years. Mean age was 43 years. Ninety per cent of patients had histologically proven positive axillary nodes, 63\\% positive hormonal receptors and 77\\% had received an anthracycline-based chemotherapy regimen. Ovarian suppression was by radiation-induced ovarian ablation (45\\% of patients) or with triptorelin (48\\%). At the time of randomization, all patients had regular menses or their follicle-stimulating hormone and estradiol levels indicated a premenopausal status. The 10-year disease-free survival rates were 49\\% {[}95\\% confidence interval (CI) 44\\% to 54\\%{]} in both arms (P = 0.51). The 10-year overall survival rates were 66\\% (95\\% CI 61\\% to 70\\%) for the ovarian suppression arm and 68\\% (95\\% CI 63\\% to 73\\%) for the control arm (P = 0.19). There were no variations in the treatment effect according to age, hormonal receptor status or ovarian suppression modality. However, in patients <40 years of age and with estrogen receptor-positive tumors, ovarian suppression significantly decreased the risk of recurrence (P = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this trial, after at least 10 years of follow-up, do not favor the use of ovarian suppression after adjuvant chemotherapy. The potential beneficial effect in younger women with hormono-dependent tumors should be further assessed. & 0                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \\\\\n",

This study was designed to determine the effect of adding gefitinib to neoadjuvant epirubicin and cyclophosphamide (EC) on tumor response rates. Women with unilateral, primary operable, estrogen receptor negative invasive breast cancer â‰¥ 2 cm were eligible for inclusion. Randomized patients were to receive four cycles of neoadjuvant EC plus 12 weeks of either gefitinib (250 mg daily) or placebo. Primary endpoint was pathologic complete response (pCR), and secondary endpoints were complete response (CR) and overall objective response (OR). 181 patients were randomized. A pCR was observed in 17\\% (12/71) of patients treated with gefitinib and in 12\\% (9/73) of patients treated with placebo (4.57\\% difference, 95\\% CI -7.19 to 6.33; P = 0.44). CR was observed in 10\\% of patients in both the gefitinib (7/71) and the placebo group (7/73) (0.27\\% difference, 95\\% CI -9.6 to 10.2; P = 0.96). There was no significant difference in OR (5.96\\%; 95\\% CI -9.9 to 21.9; P = 0.45) between the two groups. Post hoc subgroup analysis showed a significant difference in pCR between triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) and non-TNBC tumors (P = 0.03). More patients in the gefitinib arm had hematological toxicity (P = 0.15) and discontinued treatment (9/94 vs. 2/86) because of adverse events (AE). Tumor response rates were similar in the two groups. A significantly higher pCR rate was observed post hoc in TNBC versus non-TNBC independent of treatment. More patients in the gefitinib group discontinued treatment because of AE. & 1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \\\\\n",
       "\t24 & Increased 5Î±-reductase type 2 expression in human breast carcinoma following aromatase inhibitor therapy: the correlation with decreased tumor cell proliferation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   & Tumor cell proliferation and progression of breast cancer are influenced by female sex steroids. However, not all breast cancer patients respond to aromatase inhibitors (AI), and many patients become unresponsive or relapse. Recent studies demonstrate that not only estrogens but also androgens may serve as regulators of estrogen-responsive as well as estrogen-unresponsive human breast cancers. However, the mechanism underlying these androgenic actions has remained relatively unknown. Therefore, in this study, we evaluated the effects of AI upon the expression of enzymes involved in intratumoral androgen production including 17Î²-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 5 (17Î²HSD5), 5Î±-reductase types 1 and 2 (5Î±Red1 and 5Î±Red2) as well as androgen receptor (AR) levels and correlated the findings with therapeutic responses including Ki67 labeling index (Ki67). Eighty-two postmenopausal invasive ductal carcinoma patients were enrolled in CAAN study from November 2001 to April 2004. Pre- and post-treatment specimens of 29 cases were available for this study. The status of 17Î²HSD5, 5Î±Red1, 5Î±Red2, and Ki67 in pre- and post-treatment specimens were evaluated. The significant increments of 5Î±Red2 as well as AR were detected in biological response group whose Ki67 LI decreased by more than 40\\% of the pre-treatment level. This is the first study demonstrating an increment of 5Î±Red2 and AR in the group of the patients associated with Ki67 decrement following AI treatment. These results suggest that increased 5Î±Red2 and AR following AI treatment may partly contribute to reduce the tumor cell proliferation through increasing intratumoral androgen concentrations and its receptor. & 0                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \\\\\n",

The clinical benefits of adjuvant trastuzumab have been demonstrated in interim analyses of four large trials. Initial data of the combined analysis of the North Central Cancer Treatment Group (NCCTG) N9831 Intergroup trial and National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP) B-31 trial were reported in 2005. Long-term follow-up results on disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) have been awaited. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with HER2-positive operable breast cancer were randomly assigned to doxorubicin plus cyclophosphamide followed by paclitaxel with or without trastuzumab in the NCCTG N9831 and NSABP B-31 trials. The similar design of both trials allowed data from the control and trastuzumab-containing arms to be combined in a joint analysis. RESULTS: At 3.9 years of median follow-up, there continues to be a highly statistically significant reduction in DFS event rate in favor of the trastuzumab-containing arm (P < .001). Similarly, there continues to be a statistically significant 39\\% reduction in death rate in favor of the trastuzumab-containing arm (P < .001). CONCLUSION: These data demonstrate consistent DFS and OS advantages of adjuvant trastuzumab over time, with the longest follow-up reported to date. The clinical benefits continue to outweigh the risks of adverse effects. & 0                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \\\\\n",

METHODS: Ipsilateral lymph nodes (negative for metastases by routine histology) from 736 patients (participants in Trial V of the International {[}Ludwig{]} Breast Cancer Study) were examined by serial sectioning and staining with haematoxylin and eosin (two sections from each of six levels) and by immunohistochemistry of a single section (with two anticytokeratins AE-1 and CAM 5.2). After median follow-up of 12 years, disease-free and overall survival were estimated by Kaplan-Meier methods. FINDINGS: Occult nodal metastases were detected by serial sectioning and haematoxylin and eosin in 52 (7\\%) of 736 patients and by immunohistochemistry in 148 (20\\%). Only two (3\\%) of 64 invasive lobular or mixed invasive lobular and ductal cancers had node micrometastases, detected by haematoxylin and eosin, compared with 25 (39\\%) by immunohistochemistry. Occult metastases, detected by either method, were associated with significantly poor disease-free and overall survival in postmenopausal but not in premenopausal patients. Immunohistochemically detected occult lymph-node metastases remained an independent and highly significant predictor of recurrence even after control for tumour grade, tumour size, oestrogen-receptor status, vascular invasion, and treatment assignment (hazard ratio 1.79 {[}95\\% CI 1.17-2.74{]}, p=0.007). INTERPRETATION: The immunohistochemical examination of ipsilateral axillary lymph nodes is a reliable, prognostically valuable, and simple method for the detection of occult nodal metastases. Immunohistochemistry is recommended as a standard method of node examination in postmenopausal patients. & 0                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \\\\\n",

Expression of STn in colon and ovarian cancer is associated with a poor prognosis independent of tumour grade, stage or histological type. We have examined 237 cases of primary breast cancer for expression of this antigen using the antibody HB-STn (Dako). The frequency of STn expression was 31\\% in the whole group, 36\\% in the node-negative and 28\\% in the node-positive group. Survival was lower, but not significantly so, in the STn-positive group (P = 0.07), but this effect was highly significant for patients with node-positive disease (P < 0.002), the curves for node-negative disease being coincident (P = 0.31). In node-positive disease the effect was limited to those receiving adjuvant chemotherapy (P = 0.001). In a multivariate (Cox) analysis on the whole group STn staining, combined with adjuvant chemotherapy, showed a highly significant correlation with survival. In STn-negative cases, adjuvant chemotherapy improved survival (relative risk 2.3, 95\\% confidence intervals 1.4-3.9), whereas adjuvant chemotherapy did not influence survival in patients which expressed STn (relative risk 1.1, 95\\% confidence intervals 0.6-2.2). Thus, by either direct or indirect mechanisms, STn positivity appears to be a marker of resistance to adjuvant chemotherapy. & 0                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \\\\\n",

This post-hoc analysis addressed whether: (1) these prognostic factors can identify a low-risk group for whom ondansetron plus dexamethasone alone provide a high level of protection (â‰¥80\\% no emesis); (2) the NK1 receptor antagonist aprepitant improves antiemetic outcome regardless of emetic risk. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Breast cancer patients in a phase III double-blind, placebo-controlled trial were randomized to antiemetic regimens including ondansetron and dexamethasone, or aprepitant, ondansetron, and dexamethasone. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to assess the impact on emesis (but not nausea) of the regimen with aprepitant, and previously reported risk factors, including age (<55 and â‰¥55 years), ethanol use (0-4 or â‰¥5 drinks/week), history of pregnancy-related morning sickness, and history of motion sickness, using a modified intent-to-treat approach. RESULTS: Treatment with aprepitant (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.0001), older age (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.006), ethanol use (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.0048), and no history of morning sickness (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.0007) were all significantly associated with reduced likelihood of emesis. The proportion of patients with one, two, or three risk factors who remained emesis free was significantly higher with the aprepitant-containing regimen than with the active control (70.2-82.8\\% vs. 38.6-66.4\\%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Aprepitant markedly improved control of emesis in patients with one or more risk factors. This analysis did not support using risk factors for modifying the antiemetic approach. A low-risk group with zero risk factors for whom aprepitant provided little benefit was of questionable clinical utility, since they comprised less than 3\\% of patients. & 0                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \\\\\n",

Tamoxifen has been shown to decrease the risk of invasive breast cancer and decrease breast density. We sought to demonstrate and calculate the extent of change in mammographic density in women who have taken tamoxifen for up to 2 years. We evaluated mammograms from 28 high-risk women who were taking tamoxifen. Four different methods of evaluation were used: (a) two qualitative methods (Wolfe criteria and the American College of Radiology Breast Imaging and Reporting Data System criteria); (b) one semiquantitative method (mammograms were assigned one of five semiquantitative scores by visual inspection); and (c) one quantitative method (computer-aided calculation of fibroglandular area from digitized mammograms). The Wolfe criteria showed a 0.03 category decrease per year (P = 0.50). The American College of Radiology Breast Imaging and Reporting Data System criteria showed a 0.1 category decrease per year (P = 0.12). Semiquantitative criteria showed a 0.2 category decrease per year (P = 0.039). Digitized scores showed a 4.3\\% decrease per year (P = 0.0007). In conclusion, tamoxifen causes a decrease in mammographic density with use, an effect that is better quantitated with semiquantitative criteria or digitized images. Density change might become useful as a surrogate end point for the effect of tamoxifen and other chemopreventive measures, although our data do not predict an individual's degree of risk reduction. & 0                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \\\\\n",

The drug was given orally at a dose of 30-35 mg/m2 every 3 weeks. Twenty-two patients were evaluable for response. All evaluable patients were previously treated with one or more chemotherapeutic regimens, including an anthracycline in more than 50\\% of the cases. Partial remissions were obtained in 5 patients, for a response rate of 23\\%. The median duration of response was 191 days. Mild nausea and vomiting were common. Diarrhea, which occurred in less than 50\\% of the patients, was usually short-lived. Alopecia was generally minimal. Myelosuppression was the dose-limiting toxic effect. Leukopenia was frequently seen, with full recovery by day 28 in 81\\% of the courses. Thrombocytopenia was less common than leukopenia. Four cases of grade 1 acute cardiac toxicity were recorded. This study suggests that idarubicin can induce regressions in advanced carcinoma of the breast, and justifies further studies in combination with other agents. & 1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \\\\\n",

This may be due to endocrine therapy suppressing cell division, in hormone-dependent tumors, whereas chemotherapy acts mainly on active-dividing cells. A trial protocol has therefore been devised which seeks to exploit the properties of both types of therapy. Oestrogen suppression is first obtained by aminoglutethimide (Orimeten) plus hydrocortisone; after 2 weeks, ethinyloestradiol is given to induce cell division and followed 24 h later by a combination of 3 cytotoxic agents given intravenously. This pattern of therapy, repeated at regular intervals, appears to be producing favorable clinical results. A phase-III study is being started among patients with hormone-dependent advanced breast cancer. & 1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \\\\\n",

The therapeutic regimen consisted of a combination of cisplatin 100 mg/m2, given as a 24-hr infusion on day 1 and vindesine (VDS) 2 mg/m2, i.v. bolus on days 1 and 8. VDS injection was omitted on day 8 in patients with poor bone marrow reserves (prior extensive irradiation). Courses were repeated at 4-week intervals until documented disease progression. Among 46 evaluable patients, there were two complete and seven partial remissions for an overall response rate of 20\\%. These responses lasted for a median of 21 weeks (range 8-89 weeks). Remission rates according to the predominant metastatic site were as follows: soft tissue, 3/8 (38\\%); bone, 0/6 (0\\%); viscera, 6/32 (19\\%). Transient myelosuppression and gastrointestinal intolerance were almost universal. Renal function impairment and neurologic manifestations were frequently encountered but these adverse reactions were generally mild. Significant antineoplastic activity in far-advanced and heavily pretreated patients warrants further evaluation of this regimen at an earlier stage of the disease. & 1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \\\\\n",

Ten of 19 patients (53\\%) responded to primary tamoxifen therapy and six of 24 (25\\%) responded to primary estrogen therapy. Crossover responses were observed in seven of 19 (37\\%) on the secondary tamoxifen therapy and in two of 10 (20\\%) on secondary estrogen therapy, and were not related to the response to the primary hormonal maneuver. Responses were related to the presence of estrogen receptor protein (ERP), particularly for tamoxifen therapy, although responses were observed in three of six ERP negative patients receiving estrogen and in seven of 25 (28\\%) of patients with an unknown ERP status. Complications were observed in 35 instances with estrogen therapy and in only five instances with tamoxifen therapy. Initial hormonal therapy with tamoxifen in postmenopausal patients with advanced breast cancer and ERP status positive or unknown is superior to primary estrogen treatment. Secondary therapy and response to estrogen or tamoxifen is not necessarily predicted by the initial hormone response, and crossover to the alternative therapy is generally indicated. & 1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \\\\\n",

In patients pretreated with tamoxifen but not with medroxyprogesterone the response rate to aminoglutethimide was 36\\%. These results suggest that aminoglutethimide has a low activity in breast cancer patients previously exposed to medroxyprogesterone, an agent with glucocorticoid-like activity inducing adrenal suppression. & 1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \\\\\n",

After randomization, 7 patients received IFN alpha 2 two million IU m-2 day-1, s.c., 3 times a week (schedule 1) and 7 patients received 50 million IU m-2 day-1, i.v., for 5 consecutive days, every 3 weeks (schedule 2). Treatment duration was 4-21 weeks in schedule 1 and 6-24 weeks (2-8 courses) in schedule 2. Regressions were not achieved with either schedule. Treatment was associated with significant toxicity and was more severe in schedule 2. Dose limiting toxicities were leukopenia, elevation of liver enzymes, hyperglycemia and fatigue. Serum IFN activity was low or undetectable in patients on schedule 1 and high in patients on schedule 2. At 24 h, serum IFN activity was detectable in only 1/6 patients on schedule 1 as compared to 3/7 patients on schedule 2. IFN neutralizing factors were detected in the serum of only 1 patient prior to treatment but none were detected in any of the patients during or after discontinuation of treatment (4-24 weeks). IFN alpha 2 increased the expression of both HLA class 1 antigens and beta 2 microglobulin in peripheral blood lymphocytes in vivo. This effect was dose related. & 1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \\\\\n",

Thirteen patients are evaluable for response and toxicity. Partial remission was seen in six patients, with soft tissue, bone and visceral metastases and static disease in a further four patients. Median duration of response has not yet been reached (8+ months). Toxicity was mild and predictable, with no patient experiencing severe nausea and vomiting, and only four of the patients requiring a wig for alopecia. Malaise and lethargy were common in those patients receiving more than three courses, and an increase in the mean corpuscular volume (MCV) together with a fall in haemoglobin were seen in patients receiving multiple courses of treatment. The study suggests that this combination is active, and may prove useful with other agents in the treatment of breast cancer. & 1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \\\\\n",

The mean serum MTX level immediately prior to 5-FU administration was 1.37 mumols/L (1.37 X 10(-6) M). Of 29 evaluable patients with breast cancer (six of whom had received prior chemotherapy), one achieved a complete response and five achieved a partial response (total response rate, 21\\%). Among 16 evaluable patients with colorectal cancer (three of whom had received prior chemotherapy), there were no objective responses. Although hematologic toxicity was generally mild, mucositis occurred in 20 patients (severe in three), and at least one early death was attributable to toxicity. These results indicate that at doses of MTX and 5-FU which are in general use in combination chemotherapy for breast cancer, sequential treatment does not have a therapeutic advantage. In colorectal cancer, the same combination is inactive. & 1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \\\\\n",

Side effects in the medical group were minimal while surgical complications included 2 cases of CSF rhinorrhea, one leading to meningitis and death. In patients receiving aminoglutethimide, urinary free cortisol and plasma dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate fell significantly as did plasma estrone and estradiol. In the hypophysectomy group, anterior-pituitary function testing postoperatively revealed adequate suppression of gonadotropin and prolactin secretion but incomplete inhibition of the ACTH-cortisol axis in 4 of 7 surgical patients studied. Five patients initially treated with hypophysectomy experienced a further reduction of plasma (and urinary) estrone and estradiol levels when given aminoglutethimide. We conclude that estrogen suppression therapy with aminoglutethimide is a feasible alternative to surgical hypophysectomy in providing endocrine suppression and palliation in advanced breast carcinoma. & 0                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \\\\\n",

Fifteen cases were diagnosed as non-metastasising squamous cell carcinoma of larynx, pharynx, laryngopharynx, hypopharynx and tonsils. Seven cases were non-metastasising infiltrating duct carcinoma of breast and 6 cases were non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). It was observed that 3 out of 15 cases (20%) of squamous cell carcinoma cases were Mantoux test (MT) negative with a T-cell population of less than 40%, 2 out of 7 cases (28.6%) of infiltrating duct carcinoma of breast were MT negative with a T-cell population of less than 40% and 3 out of 6 cases (50%) of NHL were MT negative with a T-cell population of less than 40%. The normal controls, consisting of apparently normal healthy adults, had a T-cell population of more than 40% and were all MT positive. The patients who showed a negative skin test and a T-cell population less than 40% were further subjected to assessment of T-cell population and activity after appropriate therapy, and clinical cure of the disease. It was observed that 2 out of 3 cases (66.66%) of squamous cell carcinomas, 2 out of 2 cases (100%) of adenocarcinomas and one out of 3 cases (33.33%) of NHL showed positive conversion with a T-cell population of more than 40%.\n",
       "3                                                                                                     BACKGROUND: Among breast cancer patients, nonresponse to initial neoadjuvant chemotherapy is associated with unfavorable outcome. We compared the response of nonresponding patients who continued the same treatment with that of patients who switched to a well-tolerated non-cross-resistant regimen. METHODS: Previously untreated breast cancer patients received two 3-week cycles of docetaxel at 75 mg/m(2), doxorubicin at 50 mg/m(2), and cyclophosphamide at 500 mg/m(2) per day (TAC). Patients whose tumors did not decrease in size by at least 50% were randomly assigned to four additional cycles of TAC or to four cycles of vinorelbine at 25 mg/m(2) and capecitabine at 2000 mg/m(2) (NX). The outcome was sonographic response, defined as a reduction in the product of the two largest perpendicular diameters by at least 50%. A difference of 10% or less in the sonographic response qualified as noninferiority of the NX treatment. Pathological complete response was defined as no invasive or in situ residual tumor masses in the breast and lymph nodes. Toxic effects were assessed. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: Of 2090 patients enrolled in the GeparTrio study, 622 (29.8%) who did not respond to two initial cycles of TAC were randomly assigned to an additional four cycles of TAC (n = 321) or to four cycles of NX (n = 301). Sonographic response rate was 50.5% for the TAC arm and 51.2% for the NX arm. The difference of 0.7% (95% confidence interval = -7.1% to 8.5%) demonstrated noninferiority of NX (P = .008). Similar numbers of patients in both arms received breast-conserving surgery (184 [57.3%] in the TAC arm vs 180 [59.8%] in the NX arm) and had a pathological complete response (5.3% vs 6.0%). Fewer patients in the NX arm than in the TAC arm had hematologic toxic effects, mucositis, infections, and nail changes, but more had hand-foot syndrome and sensory neuropathy. CONCLUSION: Pathological complete responses to both regimens were marginal. Among patients who did not respond to the initial neoadjuvant TAC treatment, similar efficacy but better tolerability was observed by switching to NX than continuing with TAC.\n",
       "4    BACKGROUND: Taxanes are among the most active drugs for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer, and, as a consequence, they have also been studied in the adjuvant setting.METHODS: After breast cancer surgery, women with lymph node-positive disease were randomly assigned to treatment with fluorouracil, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide (FEC) or with FEC followed by weekly paclitaxel (FEC-P). The primary endpoint of study-5-year disease-free survival (DFS)-was assessed by Kaplan-Meier analysis. Secondary endpoints included overall survival and analysis of the prognostic and predictive value of clinical and molecular (hormone receptors by immunohistochemistry and HER2 by fluorescence in situ hybridization) markers. Associations and interactions were assessed with a multivariable Cox proportional hazards model for DFS for the following covariates: age, menopausal status, tumor size, lymph node status, type of chemotherapy, tumor size, positive lymph nodes, HER2 status, and hormone receptor status. All statistical tests were two-sided.RESULTS: Among the 1246 eligible patients, estimated rates of DFS at 5 years were 78.5% in the FEC-P arm and 72.1% in the FEC arm (difference = 6.4%, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.6% to 11.2%; P = .006). FEC-P treatment was associated with a 23% reduction in the risk of relapse compared with FEC treatment (146 relapses in the 614 patients in the FEC-P arm vs 193 relapses in the 632 patients in the FEC arm, hazard ratio [HR] = 0.77, 95% CI = 0.62 to 0.95; P = .022) and a 22% reduction in the risk of death (73 and 95 deaths, respectively, HR = 0.78, 95% CI = 0.57 to 1.06; P = .110). Among the 928 patients for whom tumor samples were centrally analyzed, type of chemotherapy (FEC vs FEC-P) (P = .017), number of involved axillary lymph nodes (P < .001), tumor size (P = .020), hormone receptor status (P = .004), and HER2 status (P = .006) were all associated with DFS. We found no statistically significant interaction between HER2 status and paclitaxel treatment or between hormone receptor status and paclitaxel treatment.CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with operable breast cancer, FEC-P treatment statistically significantly reduced the risk of relapse compared with FEC as adjuvant therapy.\n",

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 260 women with measurable metastatic breast cancer fulfilling high-risk criteria, previously untreated with chemotherapy for their metastatic disease, were randomized to receive either mitoxantrone 12 mg/m(2) or the combination of fluorouracil 500 mg/m(2), epirubicin 50 mg/m(2) and cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m(2) (FEC) every 3 weeks. Treatment was continued until complete remission plus two cycles, or until disease progression. In the case of partial remission or stable disease, treatment was stopped after 12 cycles. Second-line treatment was vindesine, mitomycin and prednisolone. Gain from treatment was estimated using a modified Brunner's score composed of time to progression, patients' rating of the treatment benefit, alopecia, vomiting and performance status. RESULTS: After recruitment from 1992 to 1997 and observation from 1997 to 1999, the final evaluation showed that single-agent treatment with mitoxantrone does not differ significantly from combination treatment with FEC in terms of response, objective remission rate, remission duration, time to response, time to best response, time to progression or overall survival. There was, however, a significant difference in gain from treatment using a modified Brunner's score favoring the single-agent treatment arm. There was no evidence that any subgroup would fare better with combination treatment. CONCLUSIONS: No significant difference was detected between the treatment with mitoxantrone as a single agent and the combination of low-dose FEC in terms of response or survival; therefore, the imperative of the necessity of first-line combination chemotherapy for patients with high-risk metastatic breast cancer may be questioned. Since toxicity and quality of life score favored the single-agent mitoxantrone treatment arm, this treatment may be offered to patients preferring quality of life to a potential small prolongation of survival.\n",

Expression of Bcl-2 was determined using immunohistochemistry on paraffin-embedded sections in a series of 441 premenopausal, lymph node-negative breast cancers of patients randomised to receive perioperative chemotherapy (5-fluorouracil, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide) or no perioperative chemotherapy. Immunohistochemistry of Bcl-2 was evaluated by scoring both staining intensity (0-3) and number of positive cells (0-2). Using these scores tumours were grouped into categories 0-6. It was found that 9.2% of the tumours were completely negative (0), 17.2% weakly (1 + 2), 41.6% moderately (3 + 4) and 31.9% strongly positive (5 + 6) for Bcl-2. A positive correlation was found between high Bcl-2 expression and oestrogen (P < 0.001) and progesterone receptor positivity (P < 0.001) and low tumour grade (P < 0.001), whereas high Bcl-2 expression was negatively correlated with p53 (P < 0.001) and c-erb-B-2 positively (P < 0.001), high Ki-67 index (P < 0.001), mitotic index (P < 0.001) and large tumour size (P = 0.006). Patients with tumours expressing high levels of Bcl-2 (overall score 3-6) had a significantly better disease-free (P = 0.004) and overall (P = 0.009) survival. However, in a multivariate model this association no longer remained significant. There was a trend for an effect of adjuvant chemotherapy on disease-free survival both for patients with Bcl-2-positive (HR-0.61, 95% CI 0.35-1.06, P = 0.07) and negative (HR = 0.55, 95% CI 0.27-1.12, P = 0.09) breast tumours at a median follow-up of 49 months. The level of Bcl-2 expression does not seem to predict response to perioperative chemotherapy in premenopausal, lymph node-negative breast cancer patients. High levels of Bcl-2 are preferentially expressed in well-differentiated tumours and are associated with favourable prognosis. However, Bcl-2 expression is not an independent prognostic factor in this patient series.\n",

Both agents are highly active as monotherapy in a number of tumors, including metastatic breast cancer. Therefore, we performed a phase I dose-finding study to determine the maximum tolerated dose of this combination regimen in patients with advanced solid tumors. A total of 45 patients were enrolled and received cyclophosphamide followed by docetaxel, both administered as 1-hour intravenous infusions once every 3 weeks. The dose levels of cyclophosphamide/docetaxel were 600/60 mg/m2 (group 0), 600/75 mg/m2 (group I), 700/75 mg/m2 (group 2), 800/75 mg/m2 (group 3), 800/85 mg/m2 (group 4), 800/75 mg/m2 (group 5), and 800/85 mg/m2 (group 6). Patients with dose-limiting neutropenia in groups 5 and 6 received 300 micrograms of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) (filgrastim [Neupogen]) support on days 2 through 9 during subsequent cycles of chemotherapy. All patients received premedication with 8 mg of dexamethasone twice daily for 5 days, beginning 1 day prior to chemotherapy. The dose-limiting toxicity was neutropenia fever. The recommended dose for phase II studies of cyclophosphamide/docetaxel is 700/75 mg/m2 in previously treated patients and 800/75 mg/m2 in previously untreated patients. G-CSF support did not allow for further dose escalation. Preliminary results from this phase I trial indicate that the combination of docetaxel and cyclophosphamide produced an objective response rate of 69% in 32 patients with metastatic breast cancer (including 3 patients who achieved complete responses).\n",

Aromatase inhibitors (AIs) are increasingly used after initial tamoxifen in the adjuvant treatment of postmenopausal early breast cancer due to their mechanism of action: a potential benefit being a reduction of uterine abnormalities caused by tamoxifen.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sonographic uterine effects of the steroidal AI exemestane were studied in 219 women participating in the Intergroup Exemestane Study: a large trial in postmenopausal women with estrogen receptor-positive (or unknown) early breast cancer, disease free after 2-3 years of tamoxifen, randomly assigned to continue tamoxifen or switch to exemestane to complete 5 years adjuvant treatment. The primary end point was the proportion of patients with abnormal (> or =5 mm) endometrial thickness (ET) on transvaginal ultrasound 24 months after randomisation.RESULTS: The analysis included 183 patients. Two years after randomisation, the proportion of patients with abnormal ET was significantly lower in the exemestane compared with tamoxifen arm (36% versus 62%, respectively; P = 0.004). This difference emerged within 6 months of switching treatment (43.5% versus 65.2%, respectively; P = 0.01) and disappeared within 12 months of treatment completion (30.8% versus 34.7%, respectively; P = 0.67).CONCLUSION: Switching from tamoxifen to exemestane significantly reverses endometrial thickening associated with continued tamoxifen.\n",

However, whether the same benefits apply also in postmenopausal women treated with adjuvant tamoxifen for similar high-risk cancer is unclear. In a randomised trial among postmenopausal women who had undergone mastectomy, we compared adjuvant tamoxifen alone with tamoxifen plus postoperative radiotherapy. METHODS: Between 1982 and 1990, postmenopausal women with high-risk breast cancer (stage II or III) were randomly assigned adjuvant tamoxifen (30 mg daily for 1 year) alone (689) or with postoperative radiotherapy to the chest wall and regional lymph nodes (686). Median follow-up was 123 months. The endpoints were first site of recurrence (locoregional recurrence, distant metastases, or both), and disease-free and overall survival. FINDINGS: Locoregional recurrence occurred in 52 (8%) of the radiotherapy plus tamoxifen group and 242 (35%) of the tamoxifen only group (p<0.001). In total there were 321 (47%) and 411 (60%) recurrences, respectively. Disease-free survival was 36% in the radiotherapy plus tamoxifen group and 24% in the tamoxifen alone group (p<0.001). Overall survival was also higher in the radiotherapy group (385 vs 434 deaths; survival 45 vs 36% at 10 years, p=0.03). INTERPRETATION: Postoperative radiotherapy decreased the risk of locoregional recurrence and was associated with improved survival in high-risk postmenopausal breast-cancer patients after mastectomy and limited axillary dissection, with 1 year of adjuvant tamoxifen treatment. Improved survival in high-risk breast cancer can best be achieved by a strategy of both locoregional and systemic tumour control.\n",

The primary study endpoint was the provider-assessed maximal grade of Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 3.0, radiation dermatitis. The secondary endpoints included provider-assessed Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Grade 3 or greater radiation dermatitis and adverse event monitoring. The patient-reported outcome measures included the Skindex-16, the Skin Toxicity Assessment Tool, a Symptom Experience Diary, and a quality-of-life self-assessment. An assessment was performed at baseline, weekly during radiotherapy, and for 2 weeks after radiotherapy.RESULTS: A total of 176 patients were enrolled between September 21, 2007, and December 7, 2007. The provider-assessed primary endpoint showed no difference in the mean maximum grade of radiation dermatitis by treatment arm (1.2 for MMF vs. 1.3 for placebo; p = .18). Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events toxicity was greater in the placebo group (p = .04), primarily from pruritus. For the patient-reported outcome measures, the maximum Skindex-16 score for the MMF group showed less itching (p = .008), less irritation (p = .01), less symptom persistence or recurrence (p = .02), and less annoyance with skin problems (p = .04). The group's maximal Skin Toxicity Assessment Tool score showed less burning sensation (p = .02) and less itching (p = .002).CONCLUSION: Patients receiving daily MMF during radiotherapy might experience reduced acute skin toxicity compared with patients receiving placebo.\n",

A controlled trial of 128 patients showed that in a variety of recurrent cases the addition of warfarin to chemotherapy doubled the 2-year survival rate. The best results were obtained in postmenopausal patients with breast cancer. Warfarin depresses cellular immune responses which might militate against its use for cases undergoing \"curative\" surgery. Instead, induction of fibrinolysis by streptokinase or Brinase is suggested, because it increases the activity of the cellular immune mechanism. The results to date of an ongoing controlled randomized trial of streptokinase with surgery of tumors of the large bowel are presented, showing that the trends are in favor of streptokinase therapy; however, insufficient time has elapsed to make it, as yet, statistically significant. The action of streptokinase-induced plasmin and Brinase on lymphocytes is described.\n",

HDC regimens were MiTepa (60 mg/m2 mitoxantrone by continuous intravenous infusion over 3 days plus 300 mg/m2 thiotepa intravenously over 2 hours daily x 3 days) and ICE (12 g/m2 ifosfamide, 1800 mg/m2 carboplatin, 2 g/m2 etoposide; all 3 by continuous intravenous over 4 days). At a median follow up >8 years, the median failure-free survival (FFS) was 13.9 months, median overall survival (OS) 29.1 months, 5-year FFS 12%s and 5-year OS 25%. Thirty-three patients underwent tandem (T) transplants; 27 underwent a single (S) HDC. Median ages for these 2 groups were 45 and 48 years; bone and liver metastases were more prevalent in the T cohort, whereas lung metastases were more prevalent in the S cohort. At a median follow up of 6.5 years for the S group and >9 years for the T group, there were 52 deaths. FFS was better for T: median 15.7 versus 7.7 months (p2 = 0.010) as was OS: median 32.7 versus 17.7 months, 2-year survival 68% versus 41%, and 5-year survival 32% versus 15% (p2 = 0.010). As a group, patients with distant metastatic breast cancer who underwent tandem transplants had a better posttransplant survival than patients who underwent a single HDC.\n",

Furthermore, the relative toxicity of doxorubicin and epirubicin remains uncertain. Patients were randomised to one of four arms; four courses of standard 3 weekly cyclophosphamide 600 mg m(-2) in combination with doxorubicin 60 mg m(-2) (AC) vs epirubicin 90 mg m(-2) (EC) 3 weekly vs the same regimens administered every 2 weeks with pegfilgrastim (G-CSF). A total of 126 patients were treated, 42 with standard AC, 42 with accelerated AC, 19 with standard EC and 23 with accelerated EC. Significantly more grade 3/4 day one neutropenia was seen with standard (6/61, 10%) compared to accelerated (0/65,) regimens (P=0.01). A trend towards more neutropenic sepsis was seen in the combined standard and accelerated AC arms (12/84, 14%) compared to the combined EC arms (1/42, 2%), P=0.06. Falls in left ventricular ejection fraction were not increased with accelerated treatment. Accelerated AC and EC with pegfilgrastim are safe and feasible regimens in the treatment of early breast cancer with less neutropenia than conventional 3 weekly schedules.\n",

The survival for patients with advanced HCC is extremely poor. This is largely attributed to the lack of effective screening methods, advanced stage at presentation, limited utility of surgical intervention and ineffective medical therapy. Over the past 30 years, many conventional cytotoxic agents have been tested and have failed to confer a survival benefit. Recently, sorafenib, a multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitor, was approved by the US FDA as first-line therapy in HCC as the first agent demonstrating survival benefit in this disease. Although the survival benefit demonstrated by sorafenib is moderate, molecular targeted therapy has brought new hope in the management of HCC.\n",

Tumour response to chemotherapy was evaluated based on histology from a surgical specimen collected upon completion of chemotherapy.RESULTS: Sixty women were enrolled into the study. Thirty-one received docetaxel followed by anthracyclines (Arm A) and 29 received drugs in the reverse order (Arm B). Most women (83%) had ductal carcinoma and 10 women (17%) had lobular or lobular/ductal carcinoma. All but one tumour were downstaged during therapy. Overall, there was no significant difference in response between the two drug regimens. However, women in Arm B who achieved complete pathological response had mean FDG-PET SUVmax reduction of 87.7% after four cycles, in contrast to those who had no or minor pathological response. These women recorded mean SUVmax reductions of only 27% (P < 0.01). Women in Arm A showed no significant difference in SUVmax response according to pathological response. Sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and positive and negative predictive values were highest in women in Arm B.CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that SUVmax uptake by breast tumours during chemotherapy can be dependent on the drugs used. Care must be taken when interpreting FDG-PET in settings where patients receive varied drug protocols.\n",

It is not known whether integration of capecitabine into an adjuvant regimen that contains a taxane, an anthracycline, and cyclophosphamide improves outcome in early breast cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Women with axillary node-positive or high-risk node-negative breast cancer were randomly assigned to receive either three cycles of docetaxel and capecitabine (TX) followed by three cycles of cyclophosphamide, epirubicin, and capecitabine (CEX; n = 753) or three cycles of docetaxel (T) followed by three cycles of cyclophosphamide, epirubicin, and fluorouracil (CEF; n = 747). The primary end point was recurrence-free survival (RFS). RESULTS: During a median follow-up time of 59 months, 214 RFS events occurred (local or distant recurrences or deaths; TX/CEX, n = 96; T/CEF, n = 118). RFS was not significantly different between the groups (hazard ratio [HR], 0.79; 95% CI, 0.60 to 1.04; P = .087; 5-year RFS, 86.6% for TX/CEX v 84.1% for T/CEF). Fifty-six patients assigned to TX/CEX died during the follow-up compared with 75 of patients assigned to T/CEF (HR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.52 to 1.04; P = .080). In exploratory analyses, TX/CEX improved breast cancer-specific survival (HR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.44 to 0.95; P = .027) and RFS in women with triple-negative disease and in women who had more than three metastatic axillary lymph nodes at the time of diagnosis. We detected little severe late toxicity. CONCLUSION: Integration of capecitabine into a regimen that contains docetaxel, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide did not improve RFS significantly compared with a similar regimen without capecitabine.\n",

Studies in animals have shown that responses to chemotherapy can be increased by dietary manipulation of tumour cell metabolism. Also dietary supplementation with the amino acid L-arginine, resulted in an increase in tumour metabolic activity expression of the nuclear activation antigen, Ki67, in patients with breast cancer. Therefore, we have carried out a randomised, double blind, placebo controlled trial to determine if L-arginine supplementation is beneficial in patients with breast cancer, undergoing neo-adjuvant chemotherapy. 96 patients were randomised to receive L-arginine (30 g/day) for three days (n = 48) or placebo (n = 48) prior to undergoing chemotherapy (doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, prednisolone), 6 pulses at 21-day intervals. Clinical and pathological responses were assessed in both groups of patients following completion of chemotherapy. The clinical response rate was 77% (23% complete and 54% partial responses) in the L-arginine treated group, compared with 71% (15% complete and 56% partial) in the placebo group of patients (p = ns). However, in patients with tumours less than 6 cm in initial diameter, there was a significant increase in the better histopathological responses in the L-arginine group, when compared with the placebo group of patients (88% vs 52%, p = 0.04). This may have important implications for clinical practice.\n",

A total of 1146 patients were included: 311 high-risk node-negative premenopausal patients and 835 high-risk node-negative or node-positive postmenopausal patients. Patients were randomized after surgery to receive either no chemotherapy (control group) or 6 courses of anthracycline-based chemotherapy (CT group). Postmenopausal patients received adjuvant tamoxifen for at least two years. Radiotherapy was delivered after completion of chemotherapy in the CT group. The 10-year disease-free survival (DFS) rates were 60% in the control group and 65% in the CT group (log-rank test, p = 0.01). The 10-year distant metastasis rates were 28% and 23% (p = 0.02), and the 10-year local recurrence rates were 12% and 10%, respectively (p = 0.24). Chemotherapy was significantly less effective in post-menopausal patients with estrogen receptor-positive tumors. Adjuvant anthracycline-based chemotherapy yielded a significant benefit for DFS by lowering the risk of distant metastases. After up to 10 years of follow-up, deferring radiotherapy after chemotherapy did not compromise local control.\n",

METHODS: Healthy women (aged 55-85 y) with osteoporosis were enrolled in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial. Participants were randomized to treatment with bazedoxifene 20 or 40 mg, raloxifene 60 mg, or placebo daily for 3 years. Endometrial and ovarian safety was assessed by periodic transvaginal ultrasonography and endometrial biopsy through 24 months. Gynecologic and breast-related adverse events were recorded throughout the study. RESULTS: Among 753 participants with available transvaginal ultrasonography data, there were no significant between-group differences in overall endometrial thickness or in the percentage of participants with endometrial thickness greater than 5 mm at 12 or 24 months. Changes in the mean endometrial thickness (+/-SE) from baseline were -0.07 +/- 0.11 mm (bazedoxifene 20 mg), 0.10 +/- 0.11 mm (bazedoxifene 40 mg), 0.16 +/- 0.12 mm (raloxifene 60 mg), and -0.08 +/- 0.11 mm (placebo) at 24 months. There was one report of endometrial hyperplasia in each group, and there were zero, two, two, and three reports of endometrial carcinoma with bazedoxifene 20 and 40 mg, raloxifene 60 mg, and placebo, respectively. There were no clinically important changes from baseline in the number or size of ovarian cysts among groups. There was a significantly lower incidence of fibrocystic breast disease (P <or= 0.05) with bazedoxifene compared with raloxifene 60 mg. CONCLUSION: Bazedoxifene was associated with a favorable endometrial, ovarian, and breast safety profile in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis.\n",

Breast cancer can be subdivided according to standard pathological parameters including histological type, grade, and assessment of proliferation. These parameters are the net result of combinations of genetic alterations effecting tumour behaviour and could potentially reflect subtypes that respond differently to endocrine treatment. AIMS: To investigate the usefulness of these parameters as predictors of the response to tamoxifen in premenopausal women with breast cancer. MATERIALS/METHODS: Clinically established pathological parameters were assessed and related to the tamoxifen response in 500 available tumour specimens from 564 premenopausal patients with breast cancer randomised to either two years of tamoxifen or no treatment with 14 years of follow up. Proliferation was further evaluated by immunohistochemical Ki-67 expression. RESULTS: Oestrogen receptor positive ductal carcinomas responded as expected to tamoxifen, whereas the difference in recurrence free survival between control and tamoxifen treated patients was less apparent in the relatively few lobular carcinomas. For histological grade, there was no obvious difference in treatment response between the groups. The relation between proliferation and tamoxifen response seemed to be more complex, with a clear response in tumours with high and low proliferation, whereas tumours with intermediate proliferation defined by Ki-67 responded more poorly. CONCLUSIONS: Clinically established pathology parameters seem to mirror the endocrine treatment response and could potentially be valuable in future treatment decisions for patients with breast cancer.\n",

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Nine hundred and twenty-six premenopausal patients with completely resected breast cancer and either axillary node involvement or histological grade 2 or 3 tumors were randomized after surgery to adjuvant chemotherapy alone (control arm) or adjuvant chemotherapy plus ovarian suppression (ovarian suppression arm). Ovarian suppression was obtained by either radiation-induced ovarian ablation or triptorelin for 3 years. The analyses were performed with Cox models stratified by center. RESULTS: Median follow-up was 9.5 years. Mean age was 43 years. Ninety per cent of patients had histologically proven positive axillary nodes, 63% positive hormonal receptors and 77% had received an anthracycline-based chemotherapy regimen. Ovarian suppression was by radiation-induced ovarian ablation (45% of patients) or with triptorelin (48%). At the time of randomization, all patients had regular menses or their follicle-stimulating hormone and estradiol levels indicated a premenopausal status. The 10-year disease-free survival rates were 49% [95% confidence interval (CI) 44% to 54%] in both arms (P = 0.51). The 10-year overall survival rates were 66% (95% CI 61% to 70%) for the ovarian suppression arm and 68% (95% CI 63% to 73%) for the control arm (P = 0.19). There were no variations in the treatment effect according to age, hormonal receptor status or ovarian suppression modality. However, in patients <40 years of age and with estrogen receptor-positive tumors, ovarian suppression significantly decreased the risk of recurrence (P = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this trial, after at least 10 years of follow-up, do not favor the use of ovarian suppression after adjuvant chemotherapy. The potential beneficial effect in younger women with hormono-dependent tumors should be further assessed.\n",

This study was designed to determine the effect of adding gefitinib to neoadjuvant epirubicin and cyclophosphamide (EC) on tumor response rates. Women with unilateral, primary operable, estrogen receptor negative invasive breast cancer â¥ 2 cm were eligible for inclusion. Randomized patients were to receive four cycles of neoadjuvant EC plus 12 weeks of either gefitinib (250 mg daily) or placebo. Primary endpoint was pathologic complete response (pCR), and secondary endpoints were complete response (CR) and overall objective response (OR). 181 patients were randomized. A pCR was observed in 17% (12/71) of patients treated with gefitinib and in 12% (9/73) of patients treated with placebo (4.57% difference, 95% CI -7.19 to 6.33; P = 0.44). CR was observed in 10% of patients in both the gefitinib (7/71) and the placebo group (7/73) (0.27% difference, 95% CI -9.6 to 10.2; P = 0.96). There was no significant difference in OR (5.96%; 95% CI -9.9 to 21.9; P = 0.45) between the two groups. Post hoc subgroup analysis showed a significant difference in pCR between triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) and non-TNBC tumors (P = 0.03). More patients in the gefitinib arm had hematological toxicity (P = 0.15) and discontinued treatment (9/94 vs. 2/86) because of adverse events (AE). Tumor response rates were similar in the two groups. A significantly higher pCR rate was observed post hoc in TNBC versus non-TNBC independent of treatment. More patients in the gefitinib group discontinued treatment because of AE.\n",

However, not all breast cancer patients respond to aromatase inhibitors (AI), and many patients become unresponsive or relapse. Recent studies demonstrate that not only estrogens but also androgens may serve as regulators of estrogen-responsive as well as estrogen-unresponsive human breast cancers. However, the mechanism underlying these androgenic actions has remained relatively unknown. Therefore, in this study, we evaluated the effects of AI upon the expression of enzymes involved in intratumoral androgen production including 17Î²-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 5 (17Î²HSD5), 5Î±-reductase types 1 and 2 (5Î±Red1 and 5Î±Red2) as well as androgen receptor (AR) levels and correlated the findings with therapeutic responses including Ki67 labeling index (Ki67). Eighty-two postmenopausal invasive ductal carcinoma patients were enrolled in CAAN study from November 2001 to April 2004. Pre- and post-treatment specimens of 29 cases were available for this study. The status of 17Î²HSD5, 5Î±Red1, 5Î±Red2, and Ki67 in pre- and post-treatment specimens were evaluated. The significant increments of 5Î±Red2 as well as AR were detected in biological response group whose Ki67 LI decreased by more than 40% of the pre-treatment level. This is the first study demonstrating an increment of 5Î±Red2 and AR in the group of the patients associated with Ki67 decrement following AI treatment. These results suggest that increased 5Î±Red2 and AR following AI treatment may partly contribute to reduce the tumor cell proliferation through increasing intratumoral androgen concentrations and its receptor.\n",

The clinical benefits of adjuvant trastuzumab have been demonstrated in interim analyses of four large trials. Initial data of the combined analysis of the North Central Cancer Treatment Group (NCCTG) N9831 Intergroup trial and National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP) B-31 trial were reported in 2005. Long-term follow-up results on disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) have been awaited. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with HER2-positive operable breast cancer were randomly assigned to doxorubicin plus cyclophosphamide followed by paclitaxel with or without trastuzumab in the NCCTG N9831 and NSABP B-31 trials. The similar design of both trials allowed data from the control and trastuzumab-containing arms to be combined in a joint analysis. RESULTS: At 3.9 years of median follow-up, there continues to be a highly statistically significant reduction in DFS event rate in favor of the trastuzumab-containing arm (P < .001). Similarly, there continues to be a statistically significant 39% reduction in death rate in favor of the trastuzumab-containing arm (P < .001). CONCLUSION: These data demonstrate consistent DFS and OS advantages of adjuvant trastuzumab over time, with the longest follow-up reported to date. The clinical benefits continue to outweigh the risks of adverse effects.\n",

METHODS: Ipsilateral lymph nodes (negative for metastases by routine histology) from 736 patients (participants in Trial V of the International [Ludwig] Breast Cancer Study) were examined by serial sectioning and staining with haematoxylin and eosin (two sections from each of six levels) and by immunohistochemistry of a single section (with two anticytokeratins AE-1 and CAM 5.2). After median follow-up of 12 years, disease-free and overall survival were estimated by Kaplan-Meier methods. FINDINGS: Occult nodal metastases were detected by serial sectioning and haematoxylin and eosin in 52 (7%) of 736 patients and by immunohistochemistry in 148 (20%). Only two (3%) of 64 invasive lobular or mixed invasive lobular and ductal cancers had node micrometastases, detected by haematoxylin and eosin, compared with 25 (39%) by immunohistochemistry. Occult metastases, detected by either method, were associated with significantly poor disease-free and overall survival in postmenopausal but not in premenopausal patients. Immunohistochemically detected occult lymph-node metastases remained an independent and highly significant predictor of recurrence even after control for tumour grade, tumour size, oestrogen-receptor status, vascular invasion, and treatment assignment (hazard ratio 1.79 [95% CI 1.17-2.74], p=0.007). INTERPRETATION: The immunohistochemical examination of ipsilateral axillary lymph nodes is a reliable, prognostically valuable, and simple method for the detection of occult nodal metastases. Immunohistochemistry is recommended as a standard method of node examination in postmenopausal patients.\n",

Expression of STn in colon and ovarian cancer is associated with a poor prognosis independent of tumour grade, stage or histological type. We have examined 237 cases of primary breast cancer for expression of this antigen using the antibody HB-STn (Dako). The frequency of STn expression was 31% in the whole group, 36% in the node-negative and 28% in the node-positive group. Survival was lower, but not significantly so, in the STn-positive group (P = 0.07), but this effect was highly significant for patients with node-positive disease (P < 0.002), the curves for node-negative disease being coincident (P = 0.31). In node-positive disease the effect was limited to those receiving adjuvant chemotherapy (P = 0.001). In a multivariate (Cox) analysis on the whole group STn staining, combined with adjuvant chemotherapy, showed a highly significant correlation with survival. In STn-negative cases, adjuvant chemotherapy improved survival (relative risk 2.3, 95% confidence intervals 1.4-3.9), whereas adjuvant chemotherapy did not influence survival in patients which expressed STn (relative risk 1.1, 95% confidence intervals 0.6-2.2). Thus, by either direct or indirect mechanisms, STn positivity appears to be a marker of resistance to adjuvant chemotherapy.\n",

This post-hoc analysis addressed whether: (1) these prognostic factors can identify a low-risk group for whom ondansetron plus dexamethasone alone provide a high level of protection (â¥80% no emesis); (2) the NK1 receptor antagonist aprepitant improves antiemetic outcome regardless of emetic risk. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Breast cancer patients in a phase III double-blind, placebo-controlled trial were randomized to antiemetic regimens including ondansetron and dexamethasone, or aprepitant, ondansetron, and dexamethasone. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to assess the impact on emesis (but not nausea) of the regimen with aprepitant, and previously reported risk factors, including age (<55 and â¥55 years), ethanol use (0-4 or â¥5 drinks/week), history of pregnancy-related morning sickness, and history of motion sickness, using a modified intent-to-treat approach. RESULTS: Treatment with aprepitant (Pâ<â0.0001), older age (Pâ=â0.006), ethanol use (Pâ=â0.0048), and no history of morning sickness (Pâ=â0.0007) were all significantly associated with reduced likelihood of emesis. The proportion of patients with one, two, or three risk factors who remained emesis free was significantly higher with the aprepitant-containing regimen than with the active control (70.2-82.8% vs. 38.6-66.4%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Aprepitant markedly improved control of emesis in patients with one or more risk factors. This analysis did not support using risk factors for modifying the antiemetic approach. A low-risk group with zero risk factors for whom aprepitant provided little benefit was of questionable clinical utility, since they comprised less than 3% of patients.\n",

Tamoxifen has been shown to decrease the risk of invasive breast cancer and decrease breast density. We sought to demonstrate and calculate the extent of change in mammographic density in women who have taken tamoxifen for up to 2 years. We evaluated mammograms from 28 high-risk women who were taking tamoxifen. Four different methods of evaluation were used: (a) two qualitative methods (Wolfe criteria and the American College of Radiology Breast Imaging and Reporting Data System criteria); (b) one semiquantitative method (mammograms were assigned one of five semiquantitative scores by visual inspection); and (c) one quantitative method (computer-aided calculation of fibroglandular area from digitized mammograms). The Wolfe criteria showed a 0.03 category decrease per year (P = 0.50). The American College of Radiology Breast Imaging and Reporting Data System criteria showed a 0.1 category decrease per year (P = 0.12). Semiquantitative criteria showed a 0.2 category decrease per year (P = 0.039). Digitized scores showed a 4.3% decrease per year (P = 0.0007). In conclusion, tamoxifen causes a decrease in mammographic density with use, an effect that is better quantitated with semiquantitative criteria or digitized images. Density change might become useful as a surrogate end point for the effect of tamoxifen and other chemopreventive measures, although our data do not predict an individual's degree of risk reduction.\n",

The drug was given orally at a dose of 30-35 mg/m2 every 3 weeks. Twenty-two patients were evaluable for response. All evaluable patients were previously treated with one or more chemotherapeutic regimens, including an anthracycline in more than 50% of the cases. Partial remissions were obtained in 5 patients, for a response rate of 23%. The median duration of response was 191 days. Mild nausea and vomiting were common. Diarrhea, which occurred in less than 50% of the patients, was usually short-lived. Alopecia was generally minimal. Myelosuppression was the dose-limiting toxic effect. Leukopenia was frequently seen, with full recovery by day 28 in 81% of the courses. Thrombocytopenia was less common than leukopenia. Four cases of grade 1 acute cardiac toxicity were recorded. This study suggests that idarubicin can induce regressions in advanced carcinoma of the breast, and justifies further studies in combination with other agents.\n",

The median patient age was 51 and all patients had a performance status of 0-2 (Karnofsky greater than or equal to 50). Thirteen patients had two or three sites of metastatic disease and seven were estrogen receptor positive. No complete or partial responses were noted. Although some patients had brief periods of stable disease, almost all patients progressed after one or two courses. Only one patient was able to receive six courses of induction therapy and a brief course of maintenance. Flu-like symptoms and nausea were seen in all patients; vomiting and anorexia were frequent. Hepatic toxicity manifested by enzyme elevation was common and was most severe in patients with liver metastases. In this study a highly purified biologically active gamma interferon was not associated with anti-tumor activity in previously treated women with metastatic breast cancer.\n",

All patients but one had received prior therapy with fluorouracil, cyclophosphamide, and methotrexate. Eight patients had partial responses (36%) with a median time to treatment failure of 6 months. Two patients (9%) showed minor responses, and their times to progression were 4 and 6 months. The response rates obtained with this drug combination were similar to those observed in earlier studies using doxorubicin alone.\n",

This may be due to endocrine therapy suppressing cell division, in hormone-dependent tumors, whereas chemotherapy acts mainly on active-dividing cells. A trial protocol has therefore been devised which seeks to exploit the properties of both types of therapy. Oestrogen suppression is first obtained by aminoglutethimide (Orimeten) plus hydrocortisone; after 2 weeks, ethinyloestradiol is given to induce cell division and followed 24 h later by a combination of 3 cytotoxic agents given intravenously. This pattern of therapy, repeated at regular intervals, appears to be producing favorable clinical results. A phase-III study is being started among patients with hormone-dependent advanced breast cancer.\n",

Nonhematologic toxicity was mild. Further evaluation of 4'-deoxydoxorubicin at this dose and schedule is not warranted in patients with advanced breast cancer.\n",

Mild to moderate nausea and mouth dryness were the most frequently encountered side effects. Hemolysis occurred in five patients who had an IgM antibody and represents the dose-limiting toxicity. Cumulative renal toxicity (World Health Organization, grade 2) was observed in one of ten patients who had received greater than 2000 mg of elliptinium.\n",

The therapeutic regimen consisted of a combination of cisplatin 100 mg/m2, given as a 24-hr infusion on day 1 and vindesine (VDS) 2 mg/m2, i.v. bolus on days 1 and 8. VDS injection was omitted on day 8 in patients with poor bone marrow reserves (prior extensive irradiation). Courses were repeated at 4-week intervals until documented disease progression. Among 46 evaluable patients, there were two complete and seven partial remissions for an overall response rate of 20%. These responses lasted for a median of 21 weeks (range 8-89 weeks). Remission rates according to the predominant metastatic site were as follows: soft tissue, 3/8 (38%); bone, 0/6 (0%); viscera, 6/32 (19%). Transient myelosuppression and gastrointestinal intolerance were almost universal. Renal function impairment and neurologic manifestations were frequently encountered but these adverse reactions were generally mild. Significant antineoplastic activity in far-advanced and heavily pretreated patients warrants further evaluation of this regimen at an earlier stage of the disease.\n",

Ten of 19 patients (53%) responded to primary tamoxifen therapy and six of 24 (25%) responded to primary estrogen therapy. Crossover responses were observed in seven of 19 (37%) on the secondary tamoxifen therapy and in two of 10 (20%) on secondary estrogen therapy, and were not related to the response to the primary hormonal maneuver. Responses were related to the presence of estrogen receptor protein (ERP), particularly for tamoxifen therapy, although responses were observed in three of six ERP negative patients receiving estrogen and in seven of 25 (28%) of patients with an unknown ERP status. Complications were observed in 35 instances with estrogen therapy and in only five instances with tamoxifen therapy. Initial hormonal therapy with tamoxifen in postmenopausal patients with advanced breast cancer and ERP status positive or unknown is superior to primary estrogen treatment. Secondary therapy and response to estrogen or tamoxifen is not necessarily predicted by the initial hormone response, and crossover to the alternative therapy is generally indicated.\n",

Twenty-six received high doses of medroxyprogesterone before entering this study. There was no significant difference in patients' characteristics with or without medroxyprogesterone pretreatment. A comparison of patients with and without prior medroxyprogesterone shows a significant difference in the response rate to aminoglutethimide-hydrocortisone (4 vs 32%, P = 0.02). In patients pretreated with tamoxifen but not with medroxyprogesterone the response rate to aminoglutethimide was 36%. These results suggest that aminoglutethimide has a low activity in breast cancer patients previously exposed to medroxyprogesterone, an agent with glucocorticoid-like activity inducing adrenal suppression.\n",

After randomization, 7 patients received IFN alpha 2 two million IU m-2 day-1, s.c., 3 times a week (schedule 1) and 7 patients received 50 million IU m-2 day-1, i.v., for 5 consecutive days, every 3 weeks (schedule 2). Treatment duration was 4-21 weeks in schedule 1 and 6-24 weeks (2-8 courses) in schedule 2. Regressions were not achieved with either schedule. Treatment was associated with significant toxicity and was more severe in schedule 2. Dose limiting toxicities were leukopenia, elevation of liver enzymes, hyperglycemia and fatigue. Serum IFN activity was low or undetectable in patients on schedule 1 and high in patients on schedule 2. At 24 h, serum IFN activity was detectable in only 1/6 patients on schedule 1 as compared to 3/7 patients on schedule 2. IFN neutralizing factors were detected in the serum of only 1 patient prior to treatment but none were detected in any of the patients during or after discontinuation of treatment (4-24 weeks). IFN alpha 2 increased the expression of both HLA class 1 antigens and beta 2 microglobulin in peripheral blood lymphocytes in vivo. This effect was dose related.\n",

Thirteen patients are evaluable for response and toxicity. Partial remission was seen in six patients, with soft tissue, bone and visceral metastases and static disease in a further four patients. Median duration of response has not yet been reached (8+ months). Toxicity was mild and predictable, with no patient experiencing severe nausea and vomiting, and only four of the patients requiring a wig for alopecia. Malaise and lethargy were common in those patients receiving more than three courses, and an increase in the mean corpuscular volume (MCV) together with a fall in haemoglobin were seen in patients receiving multiple courses of treatment. The study suggests that this combination is active, and may prove useful with other agents in the treatment of breast cancer.\n",

Only one patient, with nodal and chest wall metastases, had a sustained complete regression; two patients had stable disease; and 35 patients had disease progression. The toxicity, which was primarily hematologic, was acceptable.\n",

All patients were ambulatory (performance status greater than or equal to 50 Karnofsky scale) and almost all had received previous chemotherapy. Large intravenous dosages of 30 to 50 X 10(6) IU/m2 were given for five consecutive days every two to three weeks to 22 patients and smaller subcutaneous dosage of 2 X 10(6) IU/m2 three times a week to 11 patients. No complete or partial responses were seen. Two patients had stable disease and the remainder progressed. Flu-like syndromes were seen in all patients. Nausea, vomiting, and anorexia were frequent. Hypotension and confusion were noted in six and five patients, respectively. Life-threatening leukopenia was noted in two patients receiving intravenous dosage and thrombocytopenia was noted in one; no sepsis or bleeding complications were noted. In this study, a highly purified and biologically active rIFN-alpha 2 was not associated with activity in previously treated women with metastatic breast cancer.\n",

CR (complete remission) was achieved in 1 (3%) and PR (partial remission) in 11 (32%) patients for a median duration of 12 months. The treatment was well tolerated and in no instance was interrupted because of toxicity. This study does not support the hypothesis that the combination of MAP and TAM gives better results than the single agents.\n",

The mean serum MTX level immediately prior to 5-FU administration was 1.37 mumols/L (1.37 X 10(-6) M). Of 29 evaluable patients with breast cancer (six of whom had received prior chemotherapy), one achieved a complete response and five achieved a partial response (total response rate, 21%). Among 16 evaluable patients with colorectal cancer (three of whom had received prior chemotherapy), there were no objective responses. Although hematologic toxicity was generally mild, mucositis occurred in 20 patients (severe in three), and at least one early death was attributable to toxicity. These results indicate that at doses of MTX and 5-FU which are in general use in combination chemotherapy for breast cancer, sequential treatment does not have a therapeutic advantage. In colorectal cancer, the same combination is inactive.\n",

Three of fourteen patients experienced partial objective tumor regression with a median duration of 4.6 months following hypophysectomy, whereas 10 of 21 women receiving aminoglutethimide responded (2 complete, 8 partial) with a median duration of 11.5 months. Side effects in the medical group were minimal while surgical complications included 2 cases of CSF rhinorrhea, one leading to meningitis and death. In patients receiving aminoglutethimide, urinary free cortisol and plasma dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate fell significantly as did plasma estrone and estradiol. In the hypophysectomy group, anterior-pituitary function testing postoperatively revealed adequate suppression of gonadotropin and prolactin secretion but incomplete inhibition of the ACTH-cortisol axis in 4 of 7 surgical patients studied. Five patients initially treated with hypophysectomy experienced a further reduction of plasma (and urinary) estrone and estradiol levels when given aminoglutethimide.

Cumulative evidence suggests that AIs are not equivalent in terms of potency of estrogen suppression and that there may be differences in clinical efficacy. Thus, with no data from head-to-head comparisons of the AIs as adjuvant therapy yet available, the question of whether there are efficacy differences between the AIs remains. To help answer this question, the Femara versus Anastrozole Clinical Evaluation (FACE) is a phase IIIb open-label, randomized, multicenter trial designed to test whether letrozole or anastrozole has superior efficacy as adjuvant treatment of postmenopausal women with hormone receptor (HR)- and lymph node-positive breast cancer. Eligible patients (target accrual, N=4,000) are randomized to receive either letrozole 2.5 mg or anastrozole 1 mg daily for up to 5 years. The primary objective is to compare disease-free survival at 5 years. Secondary end points include safety, overall survival, time to distant metastases, and time to contralateral breast cancer. The FACE trial will determine whether or not letrozole offers a greater clinical benefit to postmenopausal women with HR+ early breast cancer at increased risk of early recurrence compared with anastrozole.</td><td>0                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                </td></tr>\n",

       "1258 Third-generation nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitors (AIs), letrozole and anastrozole, are superior to tamoxifen as initial therapy for early breast cancer but have not been directly compared in a head-to-head adjuvant trial. Cumulative evidence suggests that AIs are not equivalent in terms of potency of estrogen suppression and that there may be differences in clinical efficacy. Thus, with no data from head-to-head comparisons of the AIs as adjuvant therapy yet available, the question of whether there are efficacy differences between the AIs remains. To help answer this question, the Femara versus Anastrozole Clinical Evaluation (FACE) is a phase IIIb open-label, randomized, multicenter trial designed to test whether letrozole or anastrozole has superior efficacy as adjuvant treatment of postmenopausal women with hormone receptor (HR)- and lymph node-positive breast cancer. Eligible patients (target accrual, N=4,000) are randomized to receive either letrozole 2.5 mg or anastrozole 1 mg daily for up to 5 years. The primary objective is to compare disease-free survival at 5 years. Secondary end points include safety, overall survival, time to distant metastases, and time to contralateral breast cancer. The FACE trial will determine whether or not letrozole offers a greater clinical benefit to postmenopausal women with HR+ early breast cancer at increased risk of early recurrence compared with anastrozole.\n",
